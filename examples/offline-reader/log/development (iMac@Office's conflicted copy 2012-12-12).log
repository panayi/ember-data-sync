Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. </p>\n<p>We don’t know the terms of the deal, but it follows a recent partnership between the two companies where Kabam took Lord of the Rings intellectual property and parlayed that into two different titles. The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle-Earth is basically a re-skinning of their original iOS title, but it’s also done quite well on the top-grossing charts and currently holds a #21 ranking in the U.S. iPhone charts. Kevin Tsujihara, who is president of Warner Bros.

Kabam CEO Kevin Chou has already alluded to loose plans for an eventual IPO, but public markets have not been very hospitable to U.S. freemium gaming companies with Zynga’s valuation down to around $2 billion from a $14 billion figure before it filed its S-1. </p>\n<p>Kabam is one of the most heavily-funded gaming companies that has titles in the top 50 grossing on the iOS and Android. They were one of the early companies to experiment with midcore gaming on the Facebook platform. But like many other developers, they pivoted toward iOS and Android when user acquisition became expensive and complicated on the Facebook platform. </p>\n<p>“We partnered with Kabam almost a year ago to deliver incredible games for The Hobbit trilogy, arguably one of the top intellectual properties in the world,” Tsujihara said in a statement. “As we worked with Kabam, it became clear that a closer, more strategic partnership made sense for us both. Kabam is a leader in the industry and we look forward to being a part of their continued growth.”</p>\n<p>Kabam is already at work on another Hobbit title that’s currently in beta.

Here’s How Much Money It Could Make \n \n \n <div>\n <p>Now it’s time to see if Facebook Gifts will be a nice supplement to the company’s revenue, or a core chunk of it. Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential.</p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 23% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally, but there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:31 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts (And Wine) From Beta To All US Users.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:34 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:34 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", MAC: 34:15:9e:12:62:86  Sequence: 57382]]

Investors were not disclosed. Previous investors have included the CIT Gap Funds, a family of seed- and early-stage investment funds placing near-equity and equity investments in Virginia-based technology, life science, and cleantech companies.</p>\n<p>As Co-Founder and CEO John Bracken explains it, Speek was invented because the user conference call experience is awful and antiquated. The goal for Speek is to instead make the experience super simple for people and provide a high quality call.</p>\n<p>Speek hopes to disrupt the market with a service that gives each customer a unique web address of their choosing. The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved. Data can also be shared.</p>\n<p>Bracken said they have had 50 to 100 people on the platform at any one time but it’s best suited for ten to 15 people.</p>\n<p>Speek hosts its service on the backbone of the Level3 fiber network.</p>\n<p>Speek will compete in the $3 billion audio conference market  and by extension the $20 to $25 billion unified communications market. Competitors are GoToMeeting, WebEx and really any service that gives out a 10-digit number and a pin.</p>\n<p>In beta since June, the service is intended for small businesses or the person in a large business who wants an alternatieve to traditional conference calls.</p>\n<p>I like this service. It lacks the collaboration features of web conferencing services but I expect that will come. The team is strong. Bracken is one of the co-founders of Evite.com, which sold to Ticketmaster in 2001. Danny Boice is the CTO. He is the  founder of Jaxara, which sold to Pantheon in 2006.</p>\n<p>Speek makes the conference call experience much more pleasant. I do a lot of conference calls. The number, the pass code and all the audio prompts are maddening. You never know who is speaking.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Blog to discuss it. Brand new versions of Yahoo! Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Evertale, a Copenhagen-based startup originally focused on creating an automatic log of your life, including everything from phone calls to checkins to photos taken, is pivoting. Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:40 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

Picking up a name that’s easy to remember can be a boon for traffic and can add a little brand protection to a company’s arsenal. While big purchases often go unreported, top domain names have been known to fetch a high price, with “insure.com” and “sex.com” ranking as the highest on record at $16 million and $13 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Today, we can add another one to the list, as financial website Forexpros.com has purchased “Investing.com” for $2.45 million, making it the largest (known) purchase of a single domain name in 2012. Until today, dudu.com and personalloans.com ranked the highest, each selling for an estimated $1 million. According to Domaining.com, the sale puts Investing.com among the top 26 or so domain names purchased, right between coupons.com and tom.com. The largest known sale of 2011? Why that would be the purchase of social.com by Salesforce.com, of course.</p>\n<p>With the purchase, Forexpros will today launch a global financial portal under the Investing.com URL, where it plans to offer a free resource for novice and semi-professional traders and investors to find realtime quotes and charts, breaking news, financial tools, technical analysis and calendars.</p>\n<p>According to Forexpros founder and CEO Dror Efrat, the site will service all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, futures and Forex. As to why the company decided to shell out $2.45 million for the purchase? Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv. According to Efrat, Forexpros.com, which was founded in 2007, was averaging 3.6 million unique users per month before the company decided to go big and re-brand under Investing.com.</p>\n<p>“We are thrilled to launch investing.com today and believe that with our streaming real-time data, powerful analysis tools and great interface we can become a preeminent financial portal for novice and semi-professional investors and traders,” Efrat tells TechCrunch.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:42 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Top Domains: Forexpros Buys Investing.com For $2.45M, Launches One-Stop Financial Portal For Everyday Investors"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:42 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/8ejQD4-V0Yo/"], ["uuid", MAC: 34:15:9e:12:62:86  Sequence: 57387]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Google may be the world’s largest mobile advertising company, but when it comes to devices that are driving the most advertising activity, it’s iOS and not Google’s Android that seems to set the heart racing. According to mobile browser and advertising company Opera Software, iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad continue to command the most usage among consumers.</p>\n<p>In the company’s latest State of Mobile Advertising survey, which analyses activity on Opera’s network of 10,000 mobile sites and some 40 billion monthly impressions globally, iOS devices collectively accounted for 44% of all ad impressions. Android devices, meanwhile, accounted for 26% of impressions.</p>\n<p>Opera notes two trends that have continued to keep Apple’s mobile platform in the lead when it comes to mobile ads.</p>\n<p>The first is the popularity of the iPhone 5. Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:43 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:43 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", MAC: 34:15:9e:12:62:86  Sequence: 57388]]

That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Adobe is hosting an event today to show off some new updates it’s making for its Creative Cloud offerings, but here’s an advance look: The service is getting a number of exclusive updates that seem clearly designed to paint it as the upgrade path of choice, vs. the boxed and digital on-time software licensing fees that creative pros have used to get access to products like Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator in the past. New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on 200,000 paying subscribers during the first four months of availability (the most recent numbers can’t be released just yet), 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn. WebMD reported a net loss of $900K on the quarter, compared to positive income of $14.2 million during the same quarter last year. Still, its site traffic continues to grow, according to its quarterly financials, with 22 and 24 percent increases for unique visitors per month and page views between Q3 2011 and Q3 2012. So what’s behind the losses and the resulting need for budget cuts?</p>\n<p>Despite a growing audience, it seems like advertisers are either less interested or less able to create campaigns on WebMD. That may in part be because of patents being up for a number of brand-name drugs put out by major pharmaceutical brands like Pfizer and others which happened in 2012, reports the Atlanta Business Chronicle, and it could also have to do with new, tighter regulations on how those companies are allowed to advertise their wares introduced this past year.</p>\n<p>WebMD CEO Cavan Redmond defended the decision in a statement in today’s press release, alluding only to greater competition in the space, but not offering any firm explanation of what exactly led to the losses and subsequent decision:</p>\n WebMD’s value proposition for users continues to be very strong.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Back in September 2011, Farmigo took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt and launched its site for discovering and enrolling in Community Supported Agriculture programs (where you can sign up to receive boxes of fresh produce from local farms). Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital.

An Israeli app developer reckons there’s room for one more way to exchange messages, which combines the urgency of a voice with the convenience of text.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is an Android app (free to download from Google Play) that lets you respond to an incoming voice call by sending a text message or emoticon/symbol, instead of answering the call.  It also includes a ‘can you talk’ button that pings your contact to check whether they are free for a call before dialing their number – so you know whether or not to make the call in the first place.</p>\n<p>The broad-brush idea here is that you don’t always have time to answer a call – but you don’t necessarily want to flat-out reject the call since doing that is not necessarily a nuanced enough response for today’s hyper sophisticated mobile communicators.</p>\n<p>Text missives can be chosen from a list of stock phrases such as ‘Hi, what’s up?’ or ‘Getting back you’, which are pigeon-holed into basic categories like ‘work’, ‘pleasure’, ‘casual’ and ‘love’ for quick reference. You can also compose your own missives in real-time within the app so you can respond in more detail.  The point, in the app maker’s words, is to establish “the agenda of the call” before you start doing any actual talking.</p>\n<p>SayWhat also puts a lot of emphasis on fun – hence the addition of emoticons/symbols to the mix – which the developer describes as “a proven market for teenagers worldwide”.</p>\n<p>Now, before I go any further, it’s worth pointing out that Android 4.0 (and above) includes a feature – called Quick Response – that lets you respond to an incoming call with a ‘here’s one I made earlier’ pre-written text message. Which does rather steal some of SayWhat’s thunder. Presumably the app maker is hoping to add more value in its offering – by pimping it out with flourishes such as the aforementioned emoticons and categories — so you can respond to a call from your boss with a winking smilie (if you dare).</p>\n<p>Asked how it plans to distinguish its app from Android’s built-in text call reject feature, SayWhat sends me an email saying: “We’ll get back to you shortly” – so you can’t accuse them of not practising the text-based holding responses they are preaching. And indeed, they are true to their word, responding at length later to explain that their app empowers the caller by letting them find out what a call is about before they decide to answer it.</p>\n<p>“The SayWhat app adds a completely new dimension for the recipient. While you can text back with a response through a reject with a call text option, until now, you had to answer the call to find out what it’s about. The biggest value add of the app is for the recipient who now can see what the call is about before they answer it, helping to set the agenda (similar to an email subject line),” says the app maker’s CEO.  “The use cases for the app are endless. (Just think how many times are you in a meeting and the phone keeps ringing and ringing and you don’t know whether it’s an emergency or if your husband is just calling to see what’s for dinner). SayWhat answers that critical question of why someone is calling.”</p>\n<p>Moving beyond Android’s Quick Response feature, any smartphone user can of course effect a fairly similar outcome — by rejecting an incoming call and then sending an SMS to that person straight afterwards.  Or by using IM before making a call to find out if the person is free to talk. But SayWhat’s system cuts out a few steps since you can simultaneously text the caller from the call screen – thereby making it that little bit simpler to make your communications that little bit more convoluted. That, as they say, is progress.</p>\n<p>The person calling you doesn’t need to have SayWhat installed to view your ‘I can’t take your call right now but I still &lt;3 you’ missive – if they don’t have the app they’ll get your text response by SMS.  Presumably some of the more obscure symbols won’t necessarily translate to text though. “The best user experience is achieved when both sides have the app,” the CEO tells me.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the SMS response instance, there isn’t a massive difference between that and the manual method any old smartphone user can perform – i.e. pressing call reject, then composing an SMS to the caller to ask what they want — but with SayWhat you’re likely to gain a few seconds since it can all be done from within the same app.</p>\n<p>SayWhat’s CEO, Noam Wolf, disagrees that the difference between his app and IMing/manually texting someone who wants to speak to you is fairly incremental. “IM/SMS + call are two separate processes managed by two separate apps. SayWhat utilizes the Android call layer and open XMPP protocol to create the Enhanced Call Information (ECI) technology.  By bringing Enhanced Call Information (ECI) into the call we’re creating the call metadata,” he writes in an email.</p>\n<p>The wider point, though, is that being able to incorporate a little text-based, emoticon strewn back-and-forth prior to a call makes for a richer, overall communications experience – and allows people to understand the basic intent behind the call before the fact.</p>\n<p>“Text and emoticons (as well as caller information and photo if available) can play an important role before the call (pick up or reject), during and after the call (call log to remind you what you talked about at a specific date/time),” Wolf argues, stressing again that rival text-message-to-call-reject apps don’t include the option to reply by emoticon.</p>\n<p>You could say a key plank of SayWhat’s mission is to ‘verbify’ emoticons. “The real added value is in the caller side, being able to call and text (or emoticon) together and, for the recipient, they can know what the call is about before they answer it,” he says. “Another unique functionality is the exclusive ‘can you talk’ button, allowing the caller to know if the recipient is available for discussion even before making the call.”</p>\n<p>Wolf and the rest of the team behind SayWhat describe themselves as “veterans of the mobile industry”. Wolf has apparently created “dozens” of mobile apps on the Israeli market — and sold his company to Walla, part of Israeli comms company Bezeq Group.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is currently free to download and will remain so in future, says Wolf. Their business model focuses on charging for “premium content” – such as “emoticon packs” and “predefined sets of messages”. “One of the directions we plan to go is a festive holiday edition with predefined messages for Xmas, Valentines, Independence Day etc, assuming that a lot of the calls going out in the holiday season are for holiday best wishes or even offering company logos,” Wolf adds.</p>\n<p>They also plan to expand the app’s platform support in future – with iOS and Windows Phones the next two target OSes. The current SayWhat Android app is available in English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian Korean, Japanese, traditional and simplified Chinese and Hebrew flavours.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:54 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SayWhat App Helps You Find Out What A Caller Wants Before Picking Up The Phone"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:54 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/tNse-BRElB0/"], ["uuid", MAC: 34:15:9e:12:62:86  Sequence: 57395]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Toronto-based SPOKEnPHOTO launched with a simple concept in mind: to help families and loved ones separated by geography stay connected via not only shared images, but also voice recordings attached to those pictures to help better tell a story. The startup launched an iPhone app in June, but co-founder Lynne McEachern told me the iPad app, which launches today, was always in the cards, but the company wanted to get the basic product and backend right before jumping to the bigger screen.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO Album is like the iPhone version in every way, in terms of what you can do with it. You can snap photos or take them from your library, and share them with friends and family. Sharing happens asynchronously, so that family members don’t have to be up and awake at the same time to connect, and sharing is designed to be limited only to those you actually care about, rather than being more open by default, like other photo sharing services including Instagram.</p>\n<p>“Our original idea really wrapped around the iPad app, because we [McEachern and her husband] were having problems connecting with our long distance friends and family a couple of years ago when we had our twin boys,” she said. “We basically didn’t answer the phone for a whole year, and we were missing everyone’s voice. We were in contact through Facebook and email and everything, but it really wasn’t the same.”</p>\n<p>The iPhone app is still a useful component of the overall product, since it means that users can snap photos and record messages wherever they are, especially on the go when they might not have their iPad with them. But the iPad is clearly designed to be more about collecting, organizing and browsing through memories stored with the service. It features a bookshelf layout not unlike that found in Apple’s iBooks, where albums are stored. Users can organize their photos into custom albums, which use a drag-and-drop interface to help users quickly and easily create personalized layouts that look good even if the individual making them isn’t particularly creative.</p>\n<p>You can add voice to images within the app, just like in the iPhone, as well as view all your pictures in an automatically generated gallery view. Albums can be shared via email, Facebook and Twitter, and receiving parties don’t need to have the app installed, thanks to a web-based interface that lets them browse through photos and attached recorded messages.</p>\n<p>McEachern says that while the iPhone app has garnered only just under 5,000 downloads so far, she thinks the iPad app does a better job of getting the core concept across, and also helps the product stand out considerably from other image/voice combo mobile apps out there like Fotobabble (which now aims more at corporate customers). Both apps are and will remain free, with revenue possibilities coming through premium added services to be introduced later on, including physical printed albums of photos stored on the service that include hooks (like scannable codes) to bring up recorded voice messages attached to pictures.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO is self-funded for now, and McEachern says the company hopes to remain that way until it can implement its revenue plans and reach the break-even point. Early traction with the iPhone app hasn’t been amazing, but the iPad app is very well put together, and even leaving aside the added feature of voice recording, presents a more attractive and better executed photo album app than most other competitive offerings out there. Time will tell if making the leap to the tablet is the jumpstart needed to help SPOKEnPHOTO reach critical mass.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:56 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SPOKEnPHOTO Album Arrives On The iPad, Letting You Share Voice With Pictures And Organize Those Memories"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:15:56 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/J_HsiMpgXbI/"], ["uuid", MAC: 34:15:9e:12:62:86  Sequence: 57396]]

Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. </p>\n<p>We don’t know the terms of the deal, but it follows a recent partnership between the two companies where Kabam took Lord of the Rings intellectual property and parlayed that into two different titles. The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle-Earth is basically a re-skinning of their original iOS title, but it’s also done quite well on the top-grossing charts and currently holds a #21 ranking in the U.S. iPhone charts. Kevin Tsujihara, who is president of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment takes a seat on Kabam’s board while MGM’s chairman and chief executive officer Gary Barber joins as a board observer. </p>\n<p>Whatever the amount of funding it is, it adds onto Kabam’s already hefty $125 million in venture capital from four separate rounds. Kabam CEO Kevin Chou has already alluded to loose plans for an eventual IPO, but public markets have not been very hospitable to U.S. freemium gaming companies with Zynga’s valuation down to around $2 billion from a $14 billion figure before it filed its S-1. </p>\n<p>Kabam is one of the most heavily-funded gaming companies that has titles in the top 50 grossing on the iOS and Android. They were one of the early companies to experiment with midcore gaming on the Facebook platform. But like many other developers, they pivoted toward iOS and Android when user acquisition became expensive and complicated on the Facebook platform. </p>\n<p>“We partnered with Kabam almost a year ago to deliver incredible games for The Hobbit trilogy, arguably one of the top intellectual properties in the world,” Tsujihara said in a statement. “As we worked with Kabam, it became clear that a closer, more strategic partnership made sense for us both. Kabam is a leader in the industry and we look forward to being a part of their continued growth.”</p>\n<p>Kabam is already at work on another Hobbit title that’s currently in beta.

Here’s How Much Money It Could Make \n \n \n <div>\n <p>Now it’s time to see if Facebook Gifts will be a nice supplement to the company’s revenue, or a core chunk of it. Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential.</p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 23% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally, but there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:17:27 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts (And Wine) From Beta To All US Users.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:17:31 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:17:31 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", MAC: 34:15:9e:12:62:86  Sequence: 57402]]

Investors were not disclosed. Previous investors have included the CIT Gap Funds, a family of seed- and early-stage investment funds placing near-equity and equity investments in Virginia-based technology, life science, and cleantech companies.</p>\n<p>As Co-Founder and CEO John Bracken explains it, Speek was invented because the user conference call experience is awful and antiquated. The goal for Speek is to instead make the experience super simple for people and provide a high quality call.</p>\n<p>Speek hopes to disrupt the market with a service that gives each customer a unique web address of their choosing. The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved. Data can also be shared.</p>\n<p>Bracken said they have had 50 to 100 people on the platform at any one time but it’s best suited for ten to 15 people.</p>\n<p>Speek hosts its service on the backbone of the Level3 fiber network.</p>\n<p>Speek will compete in the $3 billion audio conference market  and by extension the $20 to $25 billion unified communications market. Competitors are GoToMeeting, WebEx and really any service that gives out a 10-digit number and a pin.</p>\n<p>In beta since June, the service is intended for small businesses or the person in a large business who wants an alternatieve to traditional conference calls.</p>\n<p>I like this service. It lacks the collaboration features of web conferencing services but I expect that will come. The team is strong. Bracken is one of the co-founders of Evite.com, which sold to Ticketmaster in 2001. Danny Boice is the CTO. He is the  founder of Jaxara, which sold to Pantheon in 2006.</p>\n<p>Speek makes the conference call experience much more pleasant. I do a lot of conference calls. The number, the pass code and all the audio prompts are maddening. You never know who is speaking.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Blog to discuss it. Brand new versions of Yahoo! Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Evertale, a Copenhagen-based startup originally focused on creating an automatic log of your life, including everything from phone calls to checkins to photos taken, is pivoting. Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:17:38 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

Picking up a name that’s easy to remember can be a boon for traffic and can add a little brand protection to a company’s arsenal. While big purchases often go unreported, top domain names have been known to fetch a high price, with “insure.com” and “sex.com” ranking as the highest on record at $16 million and $13 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Today, we can add another one to the list, as financial website Forexpros.com has purchased “Investing.com” for $2.45 million, making it the largest (known) purchase of a single domain name in 2012. Until today, dudu.com and personalloans.com ranked the highest, each selling for an estimated $1 million. According to Domaining.com, the sale puts Investing.com among the top 26 or so domain names purchased, right between coupons.com and tom.com. The largest known sale of 2011?

Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Google may be the world’s largest mobile advertising company, but when it comes to devices that are driving the most advertising activity, it’s iOS and not Google’s Android that seems to set the heart racing. According to mobile browser and advertising company Opera Software, iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad continue to command the most usage among consumers.</p>\n<p>In the company’s latest State of Mobile Advertising survey, which analyses activity on Opera’s network of 10,000 mobile sites and some 40 billion monthly impressions globally, iOS devices collectively accounted for 44% of all ad impressions. Android devices, meanwhile, accounted for 26% of impressions.</p>\n<p>Opera notes two trends that have continued to keep Apple’s mobile platform in the lead when it comes to mobile ads.</p>\n<p>The first is the popularity of the iPhone 5. Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:17:41 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:17:41 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", MAC: 34:15:9e:12:62:86  Sequence: 57408]]

A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Adobe is hosting an event today to show off some new updates it’s making for its Creative Cloud offerings, but here’s an advance look: The service is getting a number of exclusive updates that seem clearly designed to paint it as the upgrade path of choice, vs. the boxed and digital on-time software licensing fees that creative pros have used to get access to products like Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator in the past. New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on 200,000 paying subscribers during the first four months of availability (the most recent numbers can’t be released just yet), 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn.

Still, its site traffic continues to grow, according to its quarterly financials, with 22 and 24 percent increases for unique visitors per month and page views between Q3 2011 and Q3 2012. So what’s behind the losses and the resulting need for budget cuts?</p>\n<p>Despite a growing audience, it seems like advertisers are either less interested or less able to create campaigns on WebMD. That may in part be because of patents being up for a number of brand-name drugs put out by major pharmaceutical brands like Pfizer and others which happened in 2012, reports the Atlanta Business Chronicle, and it could also have to do with new, tighter regulations on how those companies are allowed to advertise their wares introduced this past year.</p>\n<p>WebMD CEO Cavan Redmond defended the decision in a statement in today’s press release, alluding only to greater competition in the space, but not offering any firm explanation of what exactly led to the losses and subsequent decision:</p>\n WebMD’s value proposition for users continues to be very strong.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Back in September 2011, Farmigo took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt and launched its site for discovering and enrolling in Community Supported Agriculture programs (where you can sign up to receive boxes of fresh produce from local farms). Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital.

An Israeli app developer reckons there’s room for one more way to exchange messages, which combines the urgency of a voice with the convenience of text.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is an Android app (free to download from Google Play) that lets you respond to an incoming voice call by sending a text message or emoticon/symbol, instead of answering the call.  It also includes a ‘can you talk’ button that pings your contact to check whether they are free for a call before dialing their number – so you know whether or not to make the call in the first place.</p>\n<p>The broad-brush idea here is that you don’t always have time to answer a call – but you don’t necessarily want to flat-out reject the call since doing that is not necessarily a nuanced enough response for today’s hyper sophisticated mobile communicators.</p>\n<p>Text missives can be chosen from a list of stock phrases such as ‘Hi, what’s up?’ or ‘Getting back you’, which are pigeon-holed into basic categories like ‘work’, ‘pleasure’, ‘casual’ and ‘love’ for quick reference. You can also compose your own missives in real-time within the app so you can respond in more detail.  The point, in the app maker’s words, is to establish “the agenda of the call” before you start doing any actual talking.</p>\n<p>SayWhat also puts a lot of emphasis on fun – hence the addition of emoticons/symbols to the mix – which the developer describes as “a proven market for teenagers worldwide”.</p>\n<p>Now, before I go any further, it’s worth pointing out that Android 4.0 (and above) includes a feature – called Quick Response – that lets you respond to an incoming call with a ‘here’s one I made earlier’ pre-written text message. Which does rather steal some of SayWhat’s thunder. Presumably the app maker is hoping to add more value in its offering – by pimping it out with flourishes such as the aforementioned emoticons and categories — so you can respond to a call from your boss with a winking smilie (if you dare).</p>\n<p>Asked how it plans to distinguish its app from Android’s built-in text call reject feature, SayWhat sends me an email saying: “We’ll get back to you shortly” – so you can’t accuse them of not practising the text-based holding responses they are preaching. And indeed, they are true to their word, responding at length later to explain that their app empowers the caller by letting them find out what a call is about before they decide to answer it.</p>\n<p>“The SayWhat app adds a completely new dimension for the recipient. While you can text back with a response through a reject with a call text option, until now, you had to answer the call to find out what it’s about. The biggest value add of the app is for the recipient who now can see what the call is about before they answer it, helping to set the agenda (similar to an email subject line),” says the app maker’s CEO.  “The use cases for the app are endless. (Just think how many times are you in a meeting and the phone keeps ringing and ringing and you don’t know whether it’s an emergency or if your husband is just calling to see what’s for dinner). SayWhat answers that critical question of why someone is calling.”</p>\n<p>Moving beyond Android’s Quick Response feature, any smartphone user can of course effect a fairly similar outcome — by rejecting an incoming call and then sending an SMS to that person straight afterwards.  Or by using IM before making a call to find out if the person is free to talk. But SayWhat’s system cuts out a few steps since you can simultaneously text the caller from the call screen – thereby making it that little bit simpler to make your communications that little bit more convoluted. That, as they say, is progress.</p>\n<p>The person calling you doesn’t need to have SayWhat installed to view your ‘I can’t take your call right now but I still &lt;3 you’ missive – if they don’t have the app they’ll get your text response by SMS.  Presumably some of the more obscure symbols won’t necessarily translate to text though. “The best user experience is achieved when both sides have the app,” the CEO tells me.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the SMS response instance, there isn’t a massive difference between that and the manual method any old smartphone user can perform – i.e. pressing call reject, then composing an SMS to the caller to ask what they want — but with SayWhat you’re likely to gain a few seconds since it can all be done from within the same app.</p>\n<p>SayWhat’s CEO, Noam Wolf, disagrees that the difference between his app and IMing/manually texting someone who wants to speak to you is fairly incremental. “IM/SMS + call are two separate processes managed by two separate apps. SayWhat utilizes the Android call layer and open XMPP protocol to create the Enhanced Call Information (ECI) technology.  By bringing Enhanced Call Information (ECI) into the call we’re creating the call metadata,” he writes in an email.</p>\n<p>The wider point, though, is that being able to incorporate a little text-based, emoticon strewn back-and-forth prior to a call makes for a richer, overall communications experience – and allows people to understand the basic intent behind the call before the fact.</p>\n<p>“Text and emoticons (as well as caller information and photo if available) can play an important role before the call (pick up or reject), during and after the call (call log to remind you what you talked about at a specific date/time),” Wolf argues, stressing again that rival text-message-to-call-reject apps don’t include the option to reply by emoticon.</p>\n<p>You could say a key plank of SayWhat’s mission is to ‘verbify’ emoticons. “The real added value is in the caller side, being able to call and text (or emoticon) together and, for the recipient, they can know what the call is about before they answer it,” he says. “Another unique functionality is the exclusive ‘can you talk’ button, allowing the caller to know if the recipient is available for discussion even before making the call.”</p>\n<p>Wolf and the rest of the team behind SayWhat describe themselves as “veterans of the mobile industry”. Wolf has apparently created “dozens” of mobile apps on the Israeli market — and sold his company to Walla, part of Israeli comms company Bezeq Group.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is currently free to download and will remain so in future, says Wolf. Their business model focuses on charging for “premium content” – such as “emoticon packs” and “predefined sets of messages”. “One of the directions we plan to go is a festive holiday edition with predefined messages for Xmas, Valentines, Independence Day etc, assuming that a lot of the calls going out in the holiday season are for holiday best wishes or even offering company logos,” Wolf adds.</p>\n<p>They also plan to expand the app’s platform support in future – with iOS and Windows Phones the next two target OSes. The current SayWhat Android app is available in English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian Korean, Japanese, traditional and simplified Chinese and Hebrew flavours.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:17:52 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SayWhat App Helps You Find Out What A Caller Wants Before Picking Up The Phone"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:17:52 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/tNse-BRElB0/"], ["uuid", MAC: 34:15:9e:12:62:86  Sequence: 57415]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Toronto-based SPOKEnPHOTO launched with a simple concept in mind: to help families and loved ones separated by geography stay connected via not only shared images, but also voice recordings attached to those pictures to help better tell a story. The startup launched an iPhone app in June, but co-founder Lynne McEachern told me the iPad app, which launches today, was always in the cards, but the company wanted to get the basic product and backend right before jumping to the bigger screen.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO Album is like the iPhone version in every way, in terms of what you can do with it. You can snap photos or take them from your library, and share them with friends and family. Sharing happens asynchronously, so that family members don’t have to be up and awake at the same time to connect, and sharing is designed to be limited only to those you actually care about, rather than being more open by default, like other photo sharing services including Instagram.</p>\n<p>“Our original idea really wrapped around the iPad app, because we [McEachern and her husband] were having problems connecting with our long distance friends and family a couple of years ago when we had our twin boys,” she said. “We basically didn’t answer the phone for a whole year, and we were missing everyone’s voice. We were in contact through Facebook and email and everything, but it really wasn’t the same.”</p>\n<p>The iPhone app is still a useful component of the overall product, since it means that users can snap photos and record messages wherever they are, especially on the go when they might not have their iPad with them. But the iPad is clearly designed to be more about collecting, organizing and browsing through memories stored with the service. It features a bookshelf layout not unlike that found in Apple’s iBooks, where albums are stored. Users can organize their photos into custom albums, which use a drag-and-drop interface to help users quickly and easily create personalized layouts that look good even if the individual making them isn’t particularly creative.</p>\n<p>You can add voice to images within the app, just like in the iPhone, as well as view all your pictures in an automatically generated gallery view. Albums can be shared via email, Facebook and Twitter, and receiving parties don’t need to have the app installed, thanks to a web-based interface that lets them browse through photos and attached recorded messages.</p>\n<p>McEachern says that while the iPhone app has garnered only just under 5,000 downloads so far, she thinks the iPad app does a better job of getting the core concept across, and also helps the product stand out considerably from other image/voice combo mobile apps out there like Fotobabble (which now aims more at corporate customers). Both apps are and will remain free, with revenue possibilities coming through premium added services to be introduced later on, including physical printed albums of photos stored on the service that include hooks (like scannable codes) to bring up recorded voice messages attached to pictures.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO is self-funded for now, and McEachern says the company hopes to remain that way until it can implement its revenue plans and reach the break-even point. Early traction with the iPhone app hasn’t been amazing, but the iPad app is very well put together, and even leaving aside the added feature of voice recording, presents a more attractive and better executed photo album app than most other competitive offerings out there. Time will tell if making the leap to the tablet is the jumpstart needed to help SPOKEnPHOTO reach critical mass.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:17:53 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SPOKEnPHOTO Album Arrives On The iPad, Letting You Share Voice With Pictures And Organize Those Memories"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:17:53 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/J_HsiMpgXbI/"], ["uuid", MAC: 34:15:9e:12:62:86  Sequence: 57416]]

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n \n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\n \nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n \n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n \n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy.

Here’s How Much Money It Could Make \n \n \n <div>\n <p>Now it’s time to see if Facebook Gifts will be a nice supplement to the company’s revenue, or a core chunk of it. Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential. <img></p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally, but there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year.</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy. By combining web and mobile advertising, payments taxes, and commerce instead of relying on just one, it has the flexibility to tune up or down how aggressively it monetizes each channel and hedges its risk. If it can stack enough $500 million a year revenue sources and then keeps growing them, it could keep its stock price rising or at least grow into a more comfortable earnings multiple. </p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:03 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts (And Wine) From Beta To All US Users.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:06 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:06 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", "29dfd190-25d4-0130-e051-34159e126286"]]

The goal for Speek is to instead make the experience super simple for people and provide a high quality call.</p>\n<p>Speek hopes to disrupt the market with a service that gives each customer a unique web address of their choosing. The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved. Data can also be shared.</p>\n<p>Bracken said they have had 50 to 100 people on the platform at any one time but it’s best suited for ten to 15 people.</p>\n<p>Speek hosts its service on the backbone of the Level3 fiber network.</p>\n<p>Speek will compete in the $3 billion audio conference market  and by extension the $20 to $25 billion unified communications market. Competitors are GoToMeeting, WebEx and really any service that gives out a 10-digit number and a pin.</p>\n<p>In beta since June, the service is intended for small businesses or the person in a large business who wants an alternatieve to traditional conference calls.</p>\n<p>I like this service. It lacks the collaboration features of web conferencing services but I expect that will come. The team is strong. Bracken is one of the co-founders of Evite.com, which sold to Ticketmaster in 2001. Danny Boice is the CTO. He is the  founder of Jaxara, which sold to Pantheon in 2006.</p>\n<p>Speek makes the conference call experience much more pleasant. I do a lot of conference calls.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Blog to discuss it. Brand new versions of Yahoo! Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:12 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

Why that would be the purchase of social.com by Salesforce.com, of course.</p>\n<p>With the purchase, Forexpros will today launch a global financial portal under the Investing.com URL, where it plans to offer a free resource for novice and semi-professional traders and investors to find realtime quotes and charts, breaking news, financial tools, technical analysis and calendars.</p>\n<p>According to Forexpros founder and CEO Dror Efrat, the site will service all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, futures and Forex. As to why the company decided to shell out $2.45 million for the purchase? Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv. According to Efrat, Forexpros.com, which was founded in 2007, was averaging 3.6 million unique users per month before the company decided to go big and re-brand under Investing.com.</p>\n<p>“We are thrilled to launch investing.com today and believe that with our streaming real-time data, powerful analysis tools and great interface we can become a preeminent financial portal for novice and semi-professional investors and traders,” Efrat tells TechCrunch.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:14 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Top Domains: Forexpros Buys Investing.com For $2.45M, Launches One-Stop Financial Portal For Everyday Investors"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:14 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/8ejQD4-V0Yo/"], ["uuid", "2e7e5f80-25d4-0130-e056-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Google may be the world’s largest mobile advertising company, but when it comes to devices that are driving the most advertising activity, it’s iOS and not Google’s Android that seems to set the heart racing. According to mobile browser and advertising company Opera Software, iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad continue to command the most usage among consumers.</p>\n<p>In the company’s latest State of Mobile Advertising survey, which analyses activity on Opera’s network of 10,000 mobile sites and some 40 billion monthly impressions globally, iOS devices collectively accounted for 44% of all ad impressions. Android devices, meanwhile, accounted for 26% of impressions.</p>\n<p>Opera notes two trends that have continued to keep Apple’s mobile platform in the lead when it comes to mobile ads.</p>\n<p>The first is the popularity of the iPhone 5. Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:15 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:15 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "2f5d4270-25d4-0130-e057-34159e126286"]]

A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Adobe is hosting an event today to show off some new updates it’s making for its Creative Cloud offerings, but here’s an advance look: The service is getting a number of exclusive updates that seem clearly designed to paint it as the upgrade path of choice, vs. the boxed and digital on-time software licensing fees that creative pros have used to get access to products like Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator in the past. New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on 200,000 paying subscribers during the first four months of availability (the most recent numbers can’t be released just yet), 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes. If you want more info on these new changes, be sure to check out Adobe’s live webcast of its event beginning  at 10 AM PT.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n \n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:18 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "With 200K Paid Members In 4 Months, Adobe Adds Teams To Creative Cloud, Subscriber-Exclusive Updates To Photoshop CS6"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:18 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/S_pqPUrPIQg/"], ["uuid", "312b0520-25d4-0130-e059-34159e126286"]]

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn.

So what’s behind the losses and the resulting need for budget cuts?</p>\n<p>Despite a growing audience, it seems like advertisers are either less interested or less able to create campaigns on WebMD.

Regardless, this is a pretty neat dashboard of all of your most interesting tweets:</p>\n<p>This is a pretty big week for Twitter, which just yesterday announced its latest update including photo filters, much to the surprise non-surprise of the community, especially after the whole Instagram deal.</p>\n<p>2012 was full of happiness, tragedy and everything in between. Twitter is a service that was there all along the way, as a place to share our thoughts, hopes, desires and pain. It didn’t judge.

Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital. The company has now raised a total of $10 million.</p>\n<p>Carrot.is/Harvesting from Carrot Creative on Vimeo.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n August 2009\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $2M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Farmigo is providing an alternative food system by enabling group-buying of fresh food directly from local farms &amp; producers, making it convenient and affordable to get local, seasonal food.\nA grassroots food movement has been driving the popularity of Farmerâ€™s Markets and CSA programs (Community Supported Agriculture).

An Israeli app developer reckons there’s room for one more way to exchange messages, which combines the urgency of a voice with the convenience of text.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is an Android app (free to download from Google Play) that lets you respond to an incoming voice call by sending a text message or emoticon/symbol, instead of answering the call.  It also includes a ‘can you talk’ button that pings your contact to check whether they are free for a call before dialing their number – so you know whether or not to make the call in the first place.</p>\n<p>The broad-brush idea here is that you don’t always have time to answer a call – but you don’t necessarily want to flat-out reject the call since doing that is not necessarily a nuanced enough response for today’s hyper sophisticated mobile communicators.</p>\n<p>Text missives can be chosen from a list of stock phrases such as ‘Hi, what’s up?’ or ‘Getting back you’, which are pigeon-holed into basic categories like ‘work’, ‘pleasure’, ‘casual’ and ‘love’ for quick reference. You can also compose your own missives in real-time within the app so you can respond in more detail.  The point, in the app maker’s words, is to establish “the agenda of the call” before you start doing any actual talking.</p>\n<p>SayWhat also puts a lot of emphasis on fun – hence the addition of emoticons/symbols to the mix – which the developer describes as “a proven market for teenagers worldwide”.</p>\n<p>Now, before I go any further, it’s worth pointing out that Android 4.0 (and above) includes a feature – called Quick Response – that lets you respond to an incoming call with a ‘here’s one I made earlier’ pre-written text message. Which does rather steal some of SayWhat’s thunder. Presumably the app maker is hoping to add more value in its offering – by pimping it out with flourishes such as the aforementioned emoticons and categories — so you can respond to a call from your boss with a winking smilie (if you dare).</p>\n<p>Asked how it plans to distinguish its app from Android’s built-in text call reject feature, SayWhat sends me an email saying: “We’ll get back to you shortly” – so you can’t accuse them of not practising the text-based holding responses they are preaching. And indeed, they are true to their word, responding at length later to explain that their app empowers the caller by letting them find out what a call is about before they decide to answer it.</p>\n<p>“The SayWhat app adds a completely new dimension for the recipient. While you can text back with a response through a reject with a call text option, until now, you had to answer the call to find out what it’s about. The biggest value add of the app is for the recipient who now can see what the call is about before they answer it, helping to set the agenda (similar to an email subject line),” says the app maker’s CEO.  “The use cases for the app are endless. (Just think how many times are you in a meeting and the phone keeps ringing and ringing and you don’t know whether it’s an emergency or if your husband is just calling to see what’s for dinner). SayWhat answers that critical question of why someone is calling.”</p>\n<p>Moving beyond Android’s Quick Response feature, any smartphone user can of course effect a fairly similar outcome — by rejecting an incoming call and then sending an SMS to that person straight afterwards.  Or by using IM before making a call to find out if the person is free to talk. But SayWhat’s system cuts out a few steps since you can simultaneously text the caller from the call screen – thereby making it that little bit simpler to make your communications that little bit more convoluted. That, as they say, is progress.</p>\n<p>The person calling you doesn’t need to have SayWhat installed to view your ‘I can’t take your call right now but I still &lt;3 you’ missive – if they don’t have the app they’ll get your text response by SMS.  Presumably some of the more obscure symbols won’t necessarily translate to text though. “The best user experience is achieved when both sides have the app,” the CEO tells me.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the SMS response instance, there isn’t a massive difference between that and the manual method any old smartphone user can perform – i.e. pressing call reject, then composing an SMS to the caller to ask what they want — but with SayWhat you’re likely to gain a few seconds since it can all be done from within the same app.</p>\n<p>SayWhat’s CEO, Noam Wolf, disagrees that the difference between his app and IMing/manually texting someone who wants to speak to you is fairly incremental. “IM/SMS + call are two separate processes managed by two separate apps. SayWhat utilizes the Android call layer and open XMPP protocol to create the Enhanced Call Information (ECI) technology.  By bringing Enhanced Call Information (ECI) into the call we’re creating the call metadata,” he writes in an email.</p>\n<p>The wider point, though, is that being able to incorporate a little text-based, emoticon strewn back-and-forth prior to a call makes for a richer, overall communications experience – and allows people to understand the basic intent behind the call before the fact.</p>\n<p>“Text and emoticons (as well as caller information and photo if available) can play an important role before the call (pick up or reject), during and after the call (call log to remind you what you talked about at a specific date/time),” Wolf argues, stressing again that rival text-message-to-call-reject apps don’t include the option to reply by emoticon.</p>\n<p>You could say a key plank of SayWhat’s mission is to ‘verbify’ emoticons. “The real added value is in the caller side, being able to call and text (or emoticon) together and, for the recipient, they can know what the call is about before they answer it,” he says. “Another unique functionality is the exclusive ‘can you talk’ button, allowing the caller to know if the recipient is available for discussion even before making the call.”</p>\n<p>Wolf and the rest of the team behind SayWhat describe themselves as “veterans of the mobile industry”. Wolf has apparently created “dozens” of mobile apps on the Israeli market — and sold his company to Walla, part of Israeli comms company Bezeq Group.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is currently free to download and will remain so in future, says Wolf. Their business model focuses on charging for “premium content” – such as “emoticon packs” and “predefined sets of messages”. “One of the directions we plan to go is a festive holiday edition with predefined messages for Xmas, Valentines, Independence Day etc, assuming that a lot of the calls going out in the holiday season are for holiday best wishes or even offering company logos,” Wolf adds.</p>\n<p>They also plan to expand the app’s platform support in future – with iOS and Windows Phones the next two target OSes. The current SayWhat Android app is available in English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian Korean, Japanese, traditional and simplified Chinese and Hebrew flavours.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:26 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SayWhat App Helps You Find Out What A Caller Wants Before Picking Up The Phone"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:26 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/tNse-BRElB0/"], ["uuid", "35b9a230-25d4-0130-e05e-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Toronto-based SPOKEnPHOTO launched with a simple concept in mind: to help families and loved ones separated by geography stay connected via not only shared images, but also voice recordings attached to those pictures to help better tell a story. The startup launched an iPhone app in June, but co-founder Lynne McEachern told me the iPad app, which launches today, was always in the cards, but the company wanted to get the basic product and backend right before jumping to the bigger screen.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO Album is like the iPhone version in every way, in terms of what you can do with it. You can snap photos or take them from your library, and share them with friends and family. Sharing happens asynchronously, so that family members don’t have to be up and awake at the same time to connect, and sharing is designed to be limited only to those you actually care about, rather than being more open by default, like other photo sharing services including Instagram.</p>\n<p>“Our original idea really wrapped around the iPad app, because we [McEachern and her husband] were having problems connecting with our long distance friends and family a couple of years ago when we had our twin boys,” she said. “We basically didn’t answer the phone for a whole year, and we were missing everyone’s voice. We were in contact through Facebook and email and everything, but it really wasn’t the same.”</p>\n<p>The iPhone app is still a useful component of the overall product, since it means that users can snap photos and record messages wherever they are, especially on the go when they might not have their iPad with them. But the iPad is clearly designed to be more about collecting, organizing and browsing through memories stored with the service. It features a bookshelf layout not unlike that found in Apple’s iBooks, where albums are stored. Users can organize their photos into custom albums, which use a drag-and-drop interface to help users quickly and easily create personalized layouts that look good even if the individual making them isn’t particularly creative.</p>\n<p>You can add voice to images within the app, just like in the iPhone, as well as view all your pictures in an automatically generated gallery view. Albums can be shared via email, Facebook and Twitter, and receiving parties don’t need to have the app installed, thanks to a web-based interface that lets them browse through photos and attached recorded messages.</p>\n<p>McEachern says that while the iPhone app has garnered only just under 5,000 downloads so far, she thinks the iPad app does a better job of getting the core concept across, and also helps the product stand out considerably from other image/voice combo mobile apps out there like Fotobabble (which now aims more at corporate customers). Both apps are and will remain free, with revenue possibilities coming through premium added services to be introduced later on, including physical printed albums of photos stored on the service that include hooks (like scannable codes) to bring up recorded voice messages attached to pictures.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO is self-funded for now, and McEachern says the company hopes to remain that way until it can implement its revenue plans and reach the break-even point. Early traction with the iPhone app hasn’t been amazing, but the iPad app is very well put together, and even leaving aside the added feature of voice recording, presents a more attractive and better executed photo album app than most other competitive offerings out there. Time will tell if making the leap to the tablet is the jumpstart needed to help SPOKEnPHOTO reach critical mass.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:27 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SPOKEnPHOTO Album Arrives On The iPad, Letting You Share Voice With Pictures And Organize Those Memories"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:20:27 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/J_HsiMpgXbI/"], ["uuid", "369a0740-25d4-0130-e05f-34159e126286"]]

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”\nAbout Blake Irving\nBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.\nIrving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo! Incorporated, where he developed and rolled out the unified product vision and strategy – growing the company to nearly one billion active PC and mobile users.  Prior to Yahoo, he spent 15 years at Microsoft, serving in various senior roles, most recently as Corporate Vice President of the Windows Live Platform.  While at Microsoft, Irving was responsible for creating and leading a global development and operations organization of more than 4,000 employees in the creation and operation of Microsoft’s global online services, launching several new products, including MSN Messenger and growing Hotmail from 7 million to 290 million users.\nMr. Irving currently serves on the Board of GolfLogix, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based mobile Web company.  He has also served as a professor at Pepperdine University.  He is a graduate of San Diego State and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:19 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "GoDaddy Has A New CEO: Ex-Yahoo Blake Irving"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:19 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/4MbZu2aa8_s/"], ["uuid", "973e73e0-25d5-0130-e061-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Now it’s time to see if Facebook Gifts will be a nice supplement to the company’s revenue, or a core chunk of it. Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential. <img></p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them. If it made $510 million a year, that would be $3 per year in additional average revenue per user in the US. That would nearly double the US ARPU from $3.4o to $6.40.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally, but there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been rapidly expanding the selection of what you can give. Today brings a whole new wine category plus new charitable organizations. A few weeks ago it added iTunes Gift Cards, and before that dozens of additional retailers to build on the 100+ it started with at the beginning of September when Gifts launched.</p>\n<p>Facebook’s average revenue</p>\n<p>ARPU in the US and Canada was up to $3.40</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy. By combining web and mobile advertising, payments taxes, and commerce instead of relying on just one, it has the flexibility to tune up or down how aggressively it monetizes each channel and hedges its risk. If it can stack enough $500 million a year revenue sources and then keeps growing them, it could keep its stock price rising or at least grow into a more comfortable earnings multiple.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:22 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts (And Wine) From Beta To All US Users.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:25 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:25 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", "9b226ab0-25d5-0130-e065-34159e126286"]]

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Blog to discuss it. Brand new versions of Yahoo! Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:34 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

Picking up a name that’s easy to remember can be a boon for traffic and can add a little brand protection to a company’s arsenal. While big purchases often go unreported, top domain names have been known to fetch a high price, with “insure.com” and “sex.com” ranking as the highest on record at $16 million and $13 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Today, we can add another one to the list, as financial website Forexpros.com has purchased “Investing.com” for $2.45 million, making it the largest (known) purchase of a single domain name in 2012. Until today, dudu.com and personalloans.com ranked the highest, each selling for an estimated $1 million. According to Domaining.com, the sale puts Investing.com among the top 26 or so domain names purchased, right between coupons.com and tom.com. The largest known sale of 2011? Why that would be the purchase of social.com by Salesforce.com, of course.</p>\n<p>With the purchase, Forexpros will today launch a global financial portal under the Investing.com URL, where it plans to offer a free resource for novice and semi-professional traders and investors to find realtime quotes and charts, breaking news, financial tools, technical analysis and calendars.</p>\n<p>According to Forexpros founder and CEO Dror Efrat, the site will service all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, futures and Forex. As to why the company decided to shell out $2.45 million for the purchase? Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv. According to Efrat, Forexpros.com, which was founded in 2007, was averaging 3.6 million unique users per month before the company decided to go big and re-brand under Investing.com.</p>\n<p>“We are thrilled to launch investing.com today and believe that with our streaming real-time data, powerful analysis tools and great interface we can become a preeminent financial portal for novice and semi-professional investors and traders,” Efrat tells TechCrunch.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:36 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Top Domains: Forexpros Buys Investing.com For $2.45M, Launches One-Stop Financial Portal For Everyday Investors"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:36 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/8ejQD4-V0Yo/"], ["uuid", "a172d540-25d5-0130-e06a-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Google may be the world’s largest mobile advertising company, but when it comes to devices that are driving the most advertising activity, it’s iOS and not Google’s Android that seems to set the heart racing. According to mobile browser and advertising company Opera Software, iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad continue to command the most usage among consumers.</p>\n<p>In the company’s latest State of Mobile Advertising survey, which analyses activity on Opera’s network of 10,000 mobile sites and some 40 billion monthly impressions globally, iOS devices collectively accounted for 44% of all ad impressions. Android devices, meanwhile, accounted for 26% of impressions.</p>\n<p>Opera notes two trends that have continued to keep Apple’s mobile platform in the lead when it comes to mobile ads.</p>\n<p>The first is the popularity of the iPhone 5. Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:38 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:38 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "a2b18940-25d5-0130-e06b-34159e126286"]]

A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Adobe is hosting an event today to show off some new updates it’s making for its Creative Cloud offerings, but here’s an advance look: The service is getting a number of exclusive updates that seem clearly designed to paint it as the upgrade path of choice, vs. the boxed and digital on-time software licensing fees that creative pros have used to get access to products like Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator in the past. New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on 200,000 paying subscribers during the first four months of availability (the most recent numbers can’t be released just yet), 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn. WebMD reported a net loss of $900K on the quarter, compared to positive income of $14.2 million during the same quarter last year. Still, its site traffic continues to grow, according to its quarterly financials, with 22 and 24 percent increases for unique visitors per month and page views between Q3 2011 and Q3 2012. So what’s behind the losses and the resulting need for budget cuts?</p>\n<p>Despite a growing audience, it seems like advertisers are either less interested or less able to create campaigns on WebMD. That may in part be because of patents being up for a number of brand-name drugs put out by major pharmaceutical brands like Pfizer and others which happened in 2012, reports the Atlanta Business Chronicle, and it could also have to do with new, tighter regulations on how those companies are allowed to advertise their wares introduced this past year.</p>\n<p>WebMD CEO Cavan Redmond defended the decision in a statement in today’s press release, alluding only to greater competition in the space, but not offering any firm explanation of what exactly led to the losses and subsequent decision:</p>\n WebMD’s value proposition for users continues to be very strong.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Back in September 2011, Farmigo took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt and launched its site for discovering and enrolling in Community Supported Agriculture programs (where you can sign up to receive boxes of fresh produce from local farms). Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital.

An Israeli app developer reckons there’s room for one more way to exchange messages, which combines the urgency of a voice with the convenience of text.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is an Android app (free to download from Google Play) that lets you respond to an incoming voice call by sending a text message or emoticon/symbol, instead of answering the call.  It also includes a ‘can you talk’ button that pings your contact to check whether they are free for a call before dialing their number – so you know whether or not to make the call in the first place.</p>\n<p>The broad-brush idea here is that you don’t always have time to answer a call – but you don’t necessarily want to flat-out reject the call since doing that is not necessarily a nuanced enough response for today’s hyper sophisticated mobile communicators.</p>\n<p>Text missives can be chosen from a list of stock phrases such as ‘Hi, what’s up?’ or ‘Getting back you’, which are pigeon-holed into basic categories like ‘work’, ‘pleasure’, ‘casual’ and ‘love’ for quick reference. You can also compose your own missives in real-time within the app so you can respond in more detail.  The point, in the app maker’s words, is to establish “the agenda of the call” before you start doing any actual talking.</p>\n<p>SayWhat also puts a lot of emphasis on fun – hence the addition of emoticons/symbols to the mix – which the developer describes as “a proven market for teenagers worldwide”.</p>\n<p>Now, before I go any further, it’s worth pointing out that Android 4.0 (and above) includes a feature – called Quick Response – that lets you respond to an incoming call with a ‘here’s one I made earlier’ pre-written text message. Which does rather steal some of SayWhat’s thunder. Presumably the app maker is hoping to add more value in its offering – by pimping it out with flourishes such as the aforementioned emoticons and categories — so you can respond to a call from your boss with a winking smilie (if you dare).</p>\n<p>Asked how it plans to distinguish its app from Android’s built-in text call reject feature, SayWhat sends me an email saying: “We’ll get back to you shortly” – so you can’t accuse them of not practising the text-based holding responses they are preaching. And indeed, they are true to their word, responding at length later to explain that their app empowers the caller by letting them find out what a call is about before they decide to answer it.</p>\n<p>“The SayWhat app adds a completely new dimension for the recipient. While you can text back with a response through a reject with a call text option, until now, you had to answer the call to find out what it’s about. The biggest value add of the app is for the recipient who now can see what the call is about before they answer it, helping to set the agenda (similar to an email subject line),” says the app maker’s CEO.  “The use cases for the app are endless. (Just think how many times are you in a meeting and the phone keeps ringing and ringing and you don’t know whether it’s an emergency or if your husband is just calling to see what’s for dinner). SayWhat answers that critical question of why someone is calling.”</p>\n<p>Moving beyond Android’s Quick Response feature, any smartphone user can of course effect a fairly similar outcome — by rejecting an incoming call and then sending an SMS to that person straight afterwards.  Or by using IM before making a call to find out if the person is free to talk. But SayWhat’s system cuts out a few steps since you can simultaneously text the caller from the call screen – thereby making it that little bit simpler to make your communications that little bit more convoluted. That, as they say, is progress.</p>\n<p>The person calling you doesn’t need to have SayWhat installed to view your ‘I can’t take your call right now but I still &lt;3 you’ missive – if they don’t have the app they’ll get your text response by SMS.  Presumably some of the more obscure symbols won’t necessarily translate to text though. “The best user experience is achieved when both sides have the app,” the CEO tells me.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the SMS response instance, there isn’t a massive difference between that and the manual method any old smartphone user can perform – i.e. pressing call reject, then composing an SMS to the caller to ask what they want — but with SayWhat you’re likely to gain a few seconds since it can all be done from within the same app.</p>\n<p>SayWhat’s CEO, Noam Wolf, disagrees that the difference between his app and IMing/manually texting someone who wants to speak to you is fairly incremental. “IM/SMS + call are two separate processes managed by two separate apps. SayWhat utilizes the Android call layer and open XMPP protocol to create the Enhanced Call Information (ECI) technology.  By bringing Enhanced Call Information (ECI) into the call we’re creating the call metadata,” he writes in an email.</p>\n<p>The wider point, though, is that being able to incorporate a little text-based, emoticon strewn back-and-forth prior to a call makes for a richer, overall communications experience – and allows people to understand the basic intent behind the call before the fact.</p>\n<p>“Text and emoticons (as well as caller information and photo if available) can play an important role before the call (pick up or reject), during and after the call (call log to remind you what you talked about at a specific date/time),” Wolf argues, stressing again that rival text-message-to-call-reject apps don’t include the option to reply by emoticon.</p>\n<p>You could say a key plank of SayWhat’s mission is to ‘verbify’ emoticons. “The real added value is in the caller side, being able to call and text (or emoticon) together and, for the recipient, they can know what the call is about before they answer it,” he says. “Another unique functionality is the exclusive ‘can you talk’ button, allowing the caller to know if the recipient is available for discussion even before making the call.”</p>\n<p>Wolf and the rest of the team behind SayWhat describe themselves as “veterans of the mobile industry”. Wolf has apparently created “dozens” of mobile apps on the Israeli market — and sold his company to Walla, part of Israeli comms company Bezeq Group.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is currently free to download and will remain so in future, says Wolf. Their business model focuses on charging for “premium content” – such as “emoticon packs” and “predefined sets of messages”. “One of the directions we plan to go is a festive holiday edition with predefined messages for Xmas, Valentines, Independence Day etc, assuming that a lot of the calls going out in the holiday season are for holiday best wishes or even offering company logos,” Wolf adds.</p>\n<p>They also plan to expand the app’s platform support in future – with iOS and Windows Phones the next two target OSes. The current SayWhat Android app is available in English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian Korean, Japanese, traditional and simplified Chinese and Hebrew flavours.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:50 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SayWhat App Helps You Find Out What A Caller Wants Before Picking Up The Phone"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:50 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/tNse-BRElB0/"], ["uuid", "a9ab3510-25d5-0130-e072-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Toronto-based SPOKEnPHOTO launched with a simple concept in mind: to help families and loved ones separated by geography stay connected via not only shared images, but also voice recordings attached to those pictures to help better tell a story. The startup launched an iPhone app in June, but co-founder Lynne McEachern told me the iPad app, which launches today, was always in the cards, but the company wanted to get the basic product and backend right before jumping to the bigger screen.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO Album is like the iPhone version in every way, in terms of what you can do with it. You can snap photos or take them from your library, and share them with friends and family. Sharing happens asynchronously, so that family members don’t have to be up and awake at the same time to connect, and sharing is designed to be limited only to those you actually care about, rather than being more open by default, like other photo sharing services including Instagram.</p>\n<p>“Our original idea really wrapped around the iPad app, because we [McEachern and her husband] were having problems connecting with our long distance friends and family a couple of years ago when we had our twin boys,” she said. “We basically didn’t answer the phone for a whole year, and we were missing everyone’s voice. We were in contact through Facebook and email and everything, but it really wasn’t the same.”</p>\n<p>The iPhone app is still a useful component of the overall product, since it means that users can snap photos and record messages wherever they are, especially on the go when they might not have their iPad with them. But the iPad is clearly designed to be more about collecting, organizing and browsing through memories stored with the service. It features a bookshelf layout not unlike that found in Apple’s iBooks, where albums are stored. Users can organize their photos into custom albums, which use a drag-and-drop interface to help users quickly and easily create personalized layouts that look good even if the individual making them isn’t particularly creative.</p>\n<p>You can add voice to images within the app, just like in the iPhone, as well as view all your pictures in an automatically generated gallery view. Albums can be shared via email, Facebook and Twitter, and receiving parties don’t need to have the app installed, thanks to a web-based interface that lets them browse through photos and attached recorded messages.</p>\n<p>McEachern says that while the iPhone app has garnered only just under 5,000 downloads so far, she thinks the iPad app does a better job of getting the core concept across, and also helps the product stand out considerably from other image/voice combo mobile apps out there like Fotobabble (which now aims more at corporate customers). Both apps are and will remain free, with revenue possibilities coming through premium added services to be introduced later on, including physical printed albums of photos stored on the service that include hooks (like scannable codes) to bring up recorded voice messages attached to pictures.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO is self-funded for now, and McEachern says the company hopes to remain that way until it can implement its revenue plans and reach the break-even point. Early traction with the iPhone app hasn’t been amazing, but the iPad app is very well put together, and even leaving aside the added feature of voice recording, presents a more attractive and better executed photo album app than most other competitive offerings out there. Time will tell if making the leap to the tablet is the jumpstart needed to help SPOKEnPHOTO reach critical mass.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:51 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SPOKEnPHOTO Album Arrives On The iPad, Letting You Share Voice With Pictures And Organize Those Memories"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:30:51 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/J_HsiMpgXbI/"], ["uuid", "aa911b70-25d5-0130-e073-34159e126286"]]

More to come.</p>\n GO DADDY APPOINTS BLAKE IRVING AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\nTechnology Veteran Brings Product Development Focus to Go Daddy\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”\nAbout Blake Irving\nBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.\nIrving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo! Incorporated, where he developed and rolled out the unified product vision and strategy – growing the company to nearly one billion active PC and mobile users.  Prior to Yahoo, he spent 15 years at Microsoft, serving in various senior roles, most recently as Corporate Vice President of the Windows Live Platform.  While at Microsoft, Irving was responsible for creating and leading a global development and operations organization of more than 4,000 employees in the creation and operation of Microsoft’s global online services, launching several new products, including MSN Messenger and growing Hotmail from 7 million to 290 million users.\nMr. Irving currently serves on the Board of GolfLogix, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based mobile Web company.  He has also served as a professor at Pepperdine University.  He is a graduate of San Diego State and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:33:35 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "GoDaddy Has A New CEO: Ex-Yahoo Blake Irving"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:33:35 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/4MbZu2aa8_s/"], ["uuid", "0c6f31f0-25d6-0130-e075-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Now it’s time to see if Facebook Gifts will be a nice supplement to the company’s revenue, or a core chunk of it. Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential. <img></p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them. If it made $510 million a year, that would be $3 per year in additional average revenue per user in the US. That would nearly double the US ARPU from $3.4o to $6.40.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally, but there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been rapidly expanding the selection of what you can give. Today brings a whole new wine category plus new charitable organizations. A few weeks ago it added iTunes Gift Cards, and before that dozens of additional retailers to build on the 100+ it started with at the beginning of September when Gifts launched.</p>\n<p>Facebook’s average revenue</p>\n<p>ARPU in the US and Canada was up to $3.40</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy. By combining web and mobile advertising, payments taxes, and commerce instead of relying on just one, it has the flexibility to tune up or down how aggressively it monetizes each channel and hedges its risk. If it can stack enough $500 million a year revenue sources and then keeps growing them, it could keep its stock price rising or at least grow into a more comfortable earnings multiple.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:33:39 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts (And Wine) From Beta To All US Users.

Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:33:42 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:33:42 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", "104938c0-25d6-0130-e079-34159e126286"]]

The goal for Speek is to instead make the experience super simple for people and provide a high quality call.</p>\n<p>Speek hopes to disrupt the market with a service that gives each customer a unique web address of their choosing. The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved. Data can also be shared.</p>\n<p>Bracken said they have had 50 to 100 people on the platform at any one time but it’s best suited for ten to 15 people.</p>\n<p>Speek hosts its service on the backbone of the Level3 fiber network.</p>\n<p>Speek will compete in the $3 billion audio conference market  and by extension the $20 to $25 billion unified communications market. Competitors are GoToMeeting, WebEx and really any service that gives out a 10-digit number and a pin.</p>\n<p>In beta since June, the service is intended for small businesses or the person in a large business who wants an alternatieve to traditional conference calls.</p>\n<p>I like this service.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Blog to discuss it. Brand new versions of Yahoo! Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:33:48 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

Picking up a name that’s easy to remember can be a boon for traffic and can add a little brand protection to a company’s arsenal. While big purchases often go unreported, top domain names have been known to fetch a high price, with “insure.com” and “sex.com” ranking as the highest on record at $16 million and $13 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Today, we can add another one to the list, as financial website Forexpros.com has purchased “Investing.com” for $2.45 million, making it the largest (known) purchase of a single domain name in 2012. Until today, dudu.com and personalloans.com ranked the highest, each selling for an estimated $1 million. According to Domaining.com, the sale puts Investing.com among the top 26 or so domain names purchased, right between coupons.com and tom.com. The largest known sale of 2011? Why that would be the purchase of social.com by Salesforce.com, of course.</p>\n<p>With the purchase, Forexpros will today launch a global financial portal under the Investing.com URL, where it plans to offer a free resource for novice and semi-professional traders and investors to find realtime quotes and charts, breaking news, financial tools, technical analysis and calendars.</p>\n<p>According to Forexpros founder and CEO Dror Efrat, the site will service all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, futures and Forex. As to why the company decided to shell out $2.45 million for the purchase? Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Google may be the world’s largest mobile advertising company, but when it comes to devices that are driving the most advertising activity, it’s iOS and not Google’s Android that seems to set the heart racing. According to mobile browser and advertising company Opera Software, iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad continue to command the most usage among consumers.</p>\n<p>In the company’s latest State of Mobile Advertising survey, which analyses activity on Opera’s network of 10,000 mobile sites and some 40 billion monthly impressions globally, iOS devices collectively accounted for 44% of all ad impressions. Android devices, meanwhile, accounted for 26% of impressions.</p>\n<p>Opera notes two trends that have continued to keep Apple’s mobile platform in the lead when it comes to mobile ads.</p>\n<p>The first is the popularity of the iPhone 5. Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:33:51 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:33:51 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "15ac73b0-25d6-0130-e07f-34159e126286"]]

A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Adobe is hosting an event today to show off some new updates it’s making for its Creative Cloud offerings, but here’s an advance look: The service is getting a number of exclusive updates that seem clearly designed to paint it as the upgrade path of choice, vs. the boxed and digital on-time software licensing fees that creative pros have used to get access to products like Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator in the past. New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on 200,000 paying subscribers during the first four months of availability (the most recent numbers can’t be released just yet), 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn.

It just wanted to know what was happening.</p>\n<p>I would like to humbly submit this for tweet of the year, which happened only last night:</p>\n Bummer my Instagram photo didn't show up on Twitter (Systrom Failure?)— Biz Stone (@biz) December 11, 2012 \n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 21, 2006\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $1.16B\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Created in 2006, Twitter is a global real-time communications platform with 400 million monthly visitors to twitter.com, more than 140 monthly active users around the world.\nWe see a billion tweets every 2.5 days on every conceivable topic.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Back in September 2011, Farmigo took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt and launched its site for discovering and enrolling in Community Supported Agriculture programs (where you can sign up to receive boxes of fresh produce from local farms). Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital. The company has now raised a total of $10 million.</p>\n<p>Carrot.is/Harvesting from Carrot Creative on Vimeo.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n August 2009\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $2M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Farmigo is providing an alternative food system by enabling group-buying of fresh food directly from local farms &amp; producers, making it convenient and affordable to get local, seasonal food.\nA grassroots food movement has been driving the popularity of Farmerâ€™s Markets and CSA programs (Community Supported Agriculture).

An Israeli app developer reckons there’s room for one more way to exchange messages, which combines the urgency of a voice with the convenience of text.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is an Android app (free to download from Google Play) that lets you respond to an incoming voice call by sending a text message or emoticon/symbol, instead of answering the call.  It also includes a ‘can you talk’ button that pings your contact to check whether they are free for a call before dialing their number – so you know whether or not to make the call in the first place.</p>\n<p>The broad-brush idea here is that you don’t always have time to answer a call – but you don’t necessarily want to flat-out reject the call since doing that is not necessarily a nuanced enough response for today’s hyper sophisticated mobile communicators.</p>\n<p>Text missives can be chosen from a list of stock phrases such as ‘Hi, what’s up?’ or ‘Getting back you’, which are pigeon-holed into basic categories like ‘work’, ‘pleasure’, ‘casual’ and ‘love’ for quick reference. You can also compose your own missives in real-time within the app so you can respond in more detail.  The point, in the app maker’s words, is to establish “the agenda of the call” before you start doing any actual talking.</p>\n<p>SayWhat also puts a lot of emphasis on fun – hence the addition of emoticons/symbols to the mix – which the developer describes as “a proven market for teenagers worldwide”.</p>\n<p>Now, before I go any further, it’s worth pointing out that Android 4.0 (and above) includes a feature – called Quick Response – that lets you respond to an incoming call with a ‘here’s one I made earlier’ pre-written text message. Which does rather steal some of SayWhat’s thunder. Presumably the app maker is hoping to add more value in its offering – by pimping it out with flourishes such as the aforementioned emoticons and categories — so you can respond to a call from your boss with a winking smilie (if you dare).</p>\n<p>Asked how it plans to distinguish its app from Android’s built-in text call reject feature, SayWhat sends me an email saying: “We’ll get back to you shortly” – so you can’t accuse them of not practising the text-based holding responses they are preaching. And indeed, they are true to their word, responding at length later to explain that their app empowers the caller by letting them find out what a call is about before they decide to answer it.</p>\n<p>“The SayWhat app adds a completely new dimension for the recipient. While you can text back with a response through a reject with a call text option, until now, you had to answer the call to find out what it’s about. The biggest value add of the app is for the recipient who now can see what the call is about before they answer it, helping to set the agenda (similar to an email subject line),” says the app maker’s CEO.  “The use cases for the app are endless. (Just think how many times are you in a meeting and the phone keeps ringing and ringing and you don’t know whether it’s an emergency or if your husband is just calling to see what’s for dinner). SayWhat answers that critical question of why someone is calling.”</p>\n<p>Moving beyond Android’s Quick Response feature, any smartphone user can of course effect a fairly similar outcome — by rejecting an incoming call and then sending an SMS to that person straight afterwards.  Or by using IM before making a call to find out if the person is free to talk. But SayWhat’s system cuts out a few steps since you can simultaneously text the caller from the call screen – thereby making it that little bit simpler to make your communications that little bit more convoluted. That, as they say, is progress.</p>\n<p>The person calling you doesn’t need to have SayWhat installed to view your ‘I can’t take your call right now but I still &lt;3 you’ missive – if they don’t have the app they’ll get your text response by SMS.  Presumably some of the more obscure symbols won’t necessarily translate to text though. “The best user experience is achieved when both sides have the app,” the CEO tells me.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the SMS response instance, there isn’t a massive difference between that and the manual method any old smartphone user can perform – i.e. pressing call reject, then composing an SMS to the caller to ask what they want — but with SayWhat you’re likely to gain a few seconds since it can all be done from within the same app.</p>\n<p>SayWhat’s CEO, Noam Wolf, disagrees that the difference between his app and IMing/manually texting someone who wants to speak to you is fairly incremental. “IM/SMS + call are two separate processes managed by two separate apps. SayWhat utilizes the Android call layer and open XMPP protocol to create the Enhanced Call Information (ECI) technology.  By bringing Enhanced Call Information (ECI) into the call we’re creating the call metadata,” he writes in an email.</p>\n<p>The wider point, though, is that being able to incorporate a little text-based, emoticon strewn back-and-forth prior to a call makes for a richer, overall communications experience – and allows people to understand the basic intent behind the call before the fact.</p>\n<p>“Text and emoticons (as well as caller information and photo if available) can play an important role before the call (pick up or reject), during and after the call (call log to remind you what you talked about at a specific date/time),” Wolf argues, stressing again that rival text-message-to-call-reject apps don’t include the option to reply by emoticon.</p>\n<p>You could say a key plank of SayWhat’s mission is to ‘verbify’ emoticons. “The real added value is in the caller side, being able to call and text (or emoticon) together and, for the recipient, they can know what the call is about before they answer it,” he says. “Another unique functionality is the exclusive ‘can you talk’ button, allowing the caller to know if the recipient is available for discussion even before making the call.”</p>\n<p>Wolf and the rest of the team behind SayWhat describe themselves as “veterans of the mobile industry”. Wolf has apparently created “dozens” of mobile apps on the Israeli market — and sold his company to Walla, part of Israeli comms company Bezeq Group.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is currently free to download and will remain so in future, says Wolf. Their business model focuses on charging for “premium content” – such as “emoticon packs” and “predefined sets of messages”. “One of the directions we plan to go is a festive holiday edition with predefined messages for Xmas, Valentines, Independence Day etc, assuming that a lot of the calls going out in the holiday season are for holiday best wishes or even offering company logos,” Wolf adds.</p>\n<p>They also plan to expand the app’s platform support in future – with iOS and Windows Phones the next two target OSes. The current SayWhat Android app is available in English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian Korean, Japanese, traditional and simplified Chinese and Hebrew flavours.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:34:02 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SayWhat App Helps You Find Out What A Caller Wants Before Picking Up The Phone"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:34:02 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/tNse-BRElB0/"], ["uuid", "1be20480-25d6-0130-e086-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Toronto-based SPOKEnPHOTO launched with a simple concept in mind: to help families and loved ones separated by geography stay connected via not only shared images, but also voice recordings attached to those pictures to help better tell a story. The startup launched an iPhone app in June, but co-founder Lynne McEachern told me the iPad app, which launches today, was always in the cards, but the company wanted to get the basic product and backend right before jumping to the bigger screen.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO Album is like the iPhone version in every way, in terms of what you can do with it. You can snap photos or take them from your library, and share them with friends and family. Sharing happens asynchronously, so that family members don’t have to be up and awake at the same time to connect, and sharing is designed to be limited only to those you actually care about, rather than being more open by default, like other photo sharing services including Instagram.</p>\n<p>“Our original idea really wrapped around the iPad app, because we [McEachern and her husband] were having problems connecting with our long distance friends and family a couple of years ago when we had our twin boys,” she said. “We basically didn’t answer the phone for a whole year, and we were missing everyone’s voice. We were in contact through Facebook and email and everything, but it really wasn’t the same.”</p>\n<p>The iPhone app is still a useful component of the overall product, since it means that users can snap photos and record messages wherever they are, especially on the go when they might not have their iPad with them. But the iPad is clearly designed to be more about collecting, organizing and browsing through memories stored with the service. It features a bookshelf layout not unlike that found in Apple’s iBooks, where albums are stored. Users can organize their photos into custom albums, which use a drag-and-drop interface to help users quickly and easily create personalized layouts that look good even if the individual making them isn’t particularly creative.</p>\n<p>You can add voice to images within the app, just like in the iPhone, as well as view all your pictures in an automatically generated gallery view. Albums can be shared via email, Facebook and Twitter, and receiving parties don’t need to have the app installed, thanks to a web-based interface that lets them browse through photos and attached recorded messages.</p>\n<p>McEachern says that while the iPhone app has garnered only just under 5,000 downloads so far, she thinks the iPad app does a better job of getting the core concept across, and also helps the product stand out considerably from other image/voice combo mobile apps out there like Fotobabble (which now aims more at corporate customers). Both apps are and will remain free, with revenue possibilities coming through premium added services to be introduced later on, including physical printed albums of photos stored on the service that include hooks (like scannable codes) to bring up recorded voice messages attached to pictures.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO is self-funded for now, and McEachern says the company hopes to remain that way until it can implement its revenue plans and reach the break-even point. Early traction with the iPhone app hasn’t been amazing, but the iPad app is very well put together, and even leaving aside the added feature of voice recording, presents a more attractive and better executed photo album app than most other competitive offerings out there. Time will tell if making the leap to the tablet is the jumpstart needed to help SPOKEnPHOTO reach critical mass.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:34:04 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SPOKEnPHOTO Album Arrives On The iPad, Letting You Share Voice With Pictures And Organize Those Memories"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:34:04 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/J_HsiMpgXbI/"], ["uuid", "1d3b74f0-25d6-0130-e087-34159e126286"]]

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”\nAbout Blake Irving\nBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.\nIrving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo!

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Now it’s time to see if Facebook Gifts will be a nice supplement to the company’s revenue, or a core chunk of it. Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential. <img></p>\n<p>When Facebook launched Gifts in September, it only gave a few users beta access, but allowed the service to grow organically so anyone who received a Gift gained the ability to give them. It dropped another couple tens of millions of users into Gifts in late November, and now is finally publicly available so anyone in the US can give to other people stateside.</p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them. If it made $510 million a year, that would be $3 per year in additional average revenue per user in the US. That would nearly double the US ARPU from $3.4o to $6.40.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally — something it hasn’t announced any plans to do. But there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year. That’s a big hurdle for Gifts. Even if Facebook takes off in Facebook’s core markets like the UK, Germany, and Japan, it can’t scale to countries like Brazil and India.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been rapidly expanding the selection of what you can give. Today brings a whole new wine category plus new charitable organizations. A few weeks ago it added iTunes Gift Cards, and before that dozens of additional retailers to build on the 100+ it started with at the beginning of September when Gifts launched.</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n April 4, 1974\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n NASDAQ:MSFT \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Microsoft, founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, is a veteran software company, best known for its Microsoft Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office suite of productivity software.\nStarting in 1980 Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM allowing Microsoft to sell its software package with the computers IBM manufactured. \nMicrosoft is widely used by professionals worldwide and largely dominates the American corporate market.\nAdditionally, the company has ventured into hardware with consumer products such as the Zune and...</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:11 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:11 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", "68d3c130-25d6-0130-e08d-34159e126286"]]

The goal for Speek is to instead make the experience super simple for people and provide a high quality call.</p>\n<p>Speek hopes to disrupt the market with a service that gives each customer a unique web address of their choosing. The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved. Data can also be shared.</p>\n<p>Bracken said they have had 50 to 100 people on the platform at any one time but it’s best suited for ten to 15 people.</p>\n<p>Speek hosts its service on the backbone of the Level3 fiber network.</p>\n<p>Speek will compete in the $3 billion audio conference market  and by extension the $20 to $25 billion unified communications market. Competitors are GoToMeeting, WebEx and really any service that gives out a 10-digit number and a pin.</p>\n<p>In beta since June, the service is intended for small businesses or the person in a large business who wants an alternatieve to traditional conference calls.</p>\n<p>I like this service. It lacks the collaboration features of web conferencing services but I expect that will come. The team is strong. Bracken is one of the co-founders of Evite.com, which sold to Ticketmaster in 2001. Danny Boice is the CTO. He is the  founder of Jaxara, which sold to Pantheon in 2006.</p>\n<p>Speek makes the conference call experience much more pleasant. I do a lot of conference calls.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Blog to discuss it. Brand new versions of Yahoo! Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:16 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

Why that would be the purchase of social.com by Salesforce.com, of course.</p>\n<p>With the purchase, Forexpros will today launch a global financial portal under the Investing.com URL, where it plans to offer a free resource for novice and semi-professional traders and investors to find realtime quotes and charts, breaking news, financial tools, technical analysis and calendars.</p>\n<p>According to Forexpros founder and CEO Dror Efrat, the site will service all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, futures and Forex. As to why the company decided to shell out $2.45 million for the purchase? Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv. According to Efrat, Forexpros.com, which was founded in 2007, was averaging 3.6 million unique users per month before the company decided to go big and re-brand under Investing.com.</p>\n<p>“We are thrilled to launch investing.com today and believe that with our streaming real-time data, powerful analysis tools and great interface we can become a preeminent financial portal for novice and semi-professional investors and traders,” Efrat tells TechCrunch.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:18 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Top Domains: Forexpros Buys Investing.com For $2.45M, Launches One-Stop Financial Portal For Everyday Investors"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:18 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/8ejQD4-V0Yo/"], ["uuid", "6d55ecf0-25d6-0130-e092-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Google may be the world’s largest mobile advertising company, but when it comes to devices that are driving the most advertising activity, it’s iOS and not Google’s Android that seems to set the heart racing. According to mobile browser and advertising company Opera Software, iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad continue to command the most usage among consumers.</p>\n<p>In the company’s latest State of Mobile Advertising survey, which analyses activity on Opera’s network of 10,000 mobile sites and some 40 billion monthly impressions globally, iOS devices collectively accounted for 44% of all ad impressions. Android devices, meanwhile, accounted for 26% of impressions.</p>\n<p>Opera notes two trends that have continued to keep Apple’s mobile platform in the lead when it comes to mobile ads.</p>\n<p>The first is the popularity of the iPhone 5. Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:19 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:19 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "6e33b5f0-25d6-0130-e093-34159e126286"]]

A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Adobe is hosting an event today to show off some new updates it’s making for its Creative Cloud offerings, but here’s an advance look: The service is getting a number of exclusive updates that seem clearly designed to paint it as the upgrade path of choice, vs. the boxed and digital on-time software licensing fees that creative pros have used to get access to products like Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator in the past. New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on 200,000 paying subscribers during the first four months of availability (the most recent numbers can’t be released just yet), 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes. If you want more info on these new changes, be sure to check out Adobe’s live webcast of its event beginning  at 10 AM PT.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n \n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:22 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "With 200K Paid Members In 4 Months, Adobe Adds Teams To Creative Cloud, Subscriber-Exclusive Updates To Photoshop CS6"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:22 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/S_pqPUrPIQg/"], ["uuid", "6ffa9250-25d6-0130-e095-34159e126286"]]

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn.

So what’s behind the losses and the resulting need for budget cuts?</p>\n<p>Despite a growing audience, it seems like advertisers are either less interested or less able to create campaigns on WebMD.

Regardless, this is a pretty neat dashboard of all of your most interesting tweets:</p>\n<p>This is a pretty big week for Twitter, which just yesterday announced its latest update including photo filters, much to the surprise non-surprise of the community, especially after the whole Instagram deal.</p>\n<p>2012 was full of happiness, tragedy and everything in between. Twitter is a service that was there all along the way, as a place to share our thoughts, hopes, desires and pain. It didn’t judge.

Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital. The company has now raised a total of $10 million.</p>\n<p>Carrot.is/Harvesting from Carrot Creative on Vimeo.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n August 2009\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $2M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Farmigo is providing an alternative food system by enabling group-buying of fresh food directly from local farms &amp; producers, making it convenient and affordable to get local, seasonal food.\nA grassroots food movement has been driving the popularity of Farmerâ€™s Markets and CSA programs (Community Supported Agriculture).

An Israeli app developer reckons there’s room for one more way to exchange messages, which combines the urgency of a voice with the convenience of text.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is an Android app (free to download from Google Play) that lets you respond to an incoming voice call by sending a text message or emoticon/symbol, instead of answering the call.  It also includes a ‘can you talk’ button that pings your contact to check whether they are free for a call before dialing their number – so you know whether or not to make the call in the first place.</p>\n<p>The broad-brush idea here is that you don’t always have time to answer a call – but you don’t necessarily want to flat-out reject the call since doing that is not necessarily a nuanced enough response for today’s hyper sophisticated mobile communicators.</p>\n<p>Text missives can be chosen from a list of stock phrases such as ‘Hi, what’s up?’ or ‘Getting back you’, which are pigeon-holed into basic categories like ‘work’, ‘pleasure’, ‘casual’ and ‘love’ for quick reference. You can also compose your own missives in real-time within the app so you can respond in more detail.  The point, in the app maker’s words, is to establish “the agenda of the call” before you start doing any actual talking.</p>\n<p>SayWhat also puts a lot of emphasis on fun – hence the addition of emoticons/symbols to the mix – which the developer describes as “a proven market for teenagers worldwide”.</p>\n<p>Now, before I go any further, it’s worth pointing out that Android 4.0 (and above) includes a feature – called Quick Response – that lets you respond to an incoming call with a ‘here’s one I made earlier’ pre-written text message. Which does rather steal some of SayWhat’s thunder. Presumably the app maker is hoping to add more value in its offering – by pimping it out with flourishes such as the aforementioned emoticons and categories — so you can respond to a call from your boss with a winking smilie (if you dare).</p>\n<p>Asked how it plans to distinguish its app from Android’s built-in text call reject feature, SayWhat sends me an email saying: “We’ll get back to you shortly” – so you can’t accuse them of not practising the text-based holding responses they are preaching. And indeed, they are true to their word, responding at length later to explain that their app empowers the caller by letting them find out what a call is about before they decide to answer it.</p>\n<p>“The SayWhat app adds a completely new dimension for the recipient. While you can text back with a response through a reject with a call text option, until now, you had to answer the call to find out what it’s about. The biggest value add of the app is for the recipient who now can see what the call is about before they answer it, helping to set the agenda (similar to an email subject line),” says the app maker’s CEO.  “The use cases for the app are endless. (Just think how many times are you in a meeting and the phone keeps ringing and ringing and you don’t know whether it’s an emergency or if your husband is just calling to see what’s for dinner). SayWhat answers that critical question of why someone is calling.”</p>\n<p>Moving beyond Android’s Quick Response feature, any smartphone user can of course effect a fairly similar outcome — by rejecting an incoming call and then sending an SMS to that person straight afterwards.  Or by using IM before making a call to find out if the person is free to talk. But SayWhat’s system cuts out a few steps since you can simultaneously text the caller from the call screen – thereby making it that little bit simpler to make your communications that little bit more convoluted. That, as they say, is progress.</p>\n<p>The person calling you doesn’t need to have SayWhat installed to view your ‘I can’t take your call right now but I still &lt;3 you’ missive – if they don’t have the app they’ll get your text response by SMS.  Presumably some of the more obscure symbols won’t necessarily translate to text though. “The best user experience is achieved when both sides have the app,” the CEO tells me.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the SMS response instance, there isn’t a massive difference between that and the manual method any old smartphone user can perform – i.e. pressing call reject, then composing an SMS to the caller to ask what they want — but with SayWhat you’re likely to gain a few seconds since it can all be done from within the same app.</p>\n<p>SayWhat’s CEO, Noam Wolf, disagrees that the difference between his app and IMing/manually texting someone who wants to speak to you is fairly incremental. “IM/SMS + call are two separate processes managed by two separate apps. SayWhat utilizes the Android call layer and open XMPP protocol to create the Enhanced Call Information (ECI) technology.  By bringing Enhanced Call Information (ECI) into the call we’re creating the call metadata,” he writes in an email.</p>\n<p>The wider point, though, is that being able to incorporate a little text-based, emoticon strewn back-and-forth prior to a call makes for a richer, overall communications experience – and allows people to understand the basic intent behind the call before the fact.</p>\n<p>“Text and emoticons (as well as caller information and photo if available) can play an important role before the call (pick up or reject), during and after the call (call log to remind you what you talked about at a specific date/time),” Wolf argues, stressing again that rival text-message-to-call-reject apps don’t include the option to reply by emoticon.</p>\n<p>You could say a key plank of SayWhat’s mission is to ‘verbify’ emoticons. “The real added value is in the caller side, being able to call and text (or emoticon) together and, for the recipient, they can know what the call is about before they answer it,” he says. “Another unique functionality is the exclusive ‘can you talk’ button, allowing the caller to know if the recipient is available for discussion even before making the call.”</p>\n<p>Wolf and the rest of the team behind SayWhat describe themselves as “veterans of the mobile industry”. Wolf has apparently created “dozens” of mobile apps on the Israeli market — and sold his company to Walla, part of Israeli comms company Bezeq Group.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is currently free to download and will remain so in future, says Wolf. Their business model focuses on charging for “premium content” – such as “emoticon packs” and “predefined sets of messages”. “One of the directions we plan to go is a festive holiday edition with predefined messages for Xmas, Valentines, Independence Day etc, assuming that a lot of the calls going out in the holiday season are for holiday best wishes or even offering company logos,” Wolf adds.</p>\n<p>They also plan to expand the app’s platform support in future – with iOS and Windows Phones the next two target OSes. The current SayWhat Android app is available in English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian Korean, Japanese, traditional and simplified Chinese and Hebrew flavours.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:30 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SayWhat App Helps You Find Out What A Caller Wants Before Picking Up The Phone"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:30 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/tNse-BRElB0/"], ["uuid", "746db870-25d6-0130-e09a-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Toronto-based SPOKEnPHOTO launched with a simple concept in mind: to help families and loved ones separated by geography stay connected via not only shared images, but also voice recordings attached to those pictures to help better tell a story. The startup launched an iPhone app in June, but co-founder Lynne McEachern told me the iPad app, which launches today, was always in the cards, but the company wanted to get the basic product and backend right before jumping to the bigger screen.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO Album is like the iPhone version in every way, in terms of what you can do with it. You can snap photos or take them from your library, and share them with friends and family. Sharing happens asynchronously, so that family members don’t have to be up and awake at the same time to connect, and sharing is designed to be limited only to those you actually care about, rather than being more open by default, like other photo sharing services including Instagram.</p>\n<p>“Our original idea really wrapped around the iPad app, because we [McEachern and her husband] were having problems connecting with our long distance friends and family a couple of years ago when we had our twin boys,” she said. “We basically didn’t answer the phone for a whole year, and we were missing everyone’s voice. We were in contact through Facebook and email and everything, but it really wasn’t the same.”</p>\n<p>The iPhone app is still a useful component of the overall product, since it means that users can snap photos and record messages wherever they are, especially on the go when they might not have their iPad with them. But the iPad is clearly designed to be more about collecting, organizing and browsing through memories stored with the service. It features a bookshelf layout not unlike that found in Apple’s iBooks, where albums are stored. Users can organize their photos into custom albums, which use a drag-and-drop interface to help users quickly and easily create personalized layouts that look good even if the individual making them isn’t particularly creative.</p>\n<p>You can add voice to images within the app, just like in the iPhone, as well as view all your pictures in an automatically generated gallery view. Albums can be shared via email, Facebook and Twitter, and receiving parties don’t need to have the app installed, thanks to a web-based interface that lets them browse through photos and attached recorded messages.</p>\n<p>McEachern says that while the iPhone app has garnered only just under 5,000 downloads so far, she thinks the iPad app does a better job of getting the core concept across, and also helps the product stand out considerably from other image/voice combo mobile apps out there like Fotobabble (which now aims more at corporate customers). Both apps are and will remain free, with revenue possibilities coming through premium added services to be introduced later on, including physical printed albums of photos stored on the service that include hooks (like scannable codes) to bring up recorded voice messages attached to pictures.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO is self-funded for now, and McEachern says the company hopes to remain that way until it can implement its revenue plans and reach the break-even point. Early traction with the iPhone app hasn’t been amazing, but the iPad app is very well put together, and even leaving aside the added feature of voice recording, presents a more attractive and better executed photo album app than most other competitive offerings out there. Time will tell if making the leap to the tablet is the jumpstart needed to help SPOKEnPHOTO reach critical mass.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:31 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SPOKEnPHOTO Album Arrives On The iPad, Letting You Share Voice With Pictures And Organize Those Memories"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:36:31 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/J_HsiMpgXbI/"], ["uuid", "754c30f0-25d6-0130-e09b-34159e126286"]]

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”\nAbout Blake Irving\nBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.\nIrving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo! Incorporated, where he developed and rolled out the unified product vision and strategy – growing the company to nearly one billion active PC and mobile users.  Prior to Yahoo, he spent 15 years at Microsoft, serving in various senior roles, most recently as Corporate Vice President of the Windows Live Platform.  While at Microsoft, Irving was responsible for creating and leading a global development and operations organization of more than 4,000 employees in the creation and operation of Microsoft’s global online services, launching several new products, including MSN Messenger and growing Hotmail from 7 million to 290 million users.\nMr. Irving currently serves on the Board of GolfLogix, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based mobile Web company.  He has also served as a professor at Pepperdine University.  He is a graduate of San Diego State and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:25 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "GoDaddy Has A New CEO: Ex-Yahoo Blake Irving"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:25 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/4MbZu2aa8_s/"], ["uuid", "b92d7df0-25d6-0130-e09d-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Now it’s time to see if Facebook Gifts will be a nice supplement to the company’s revenue, or a core chunk of it. Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential. <img></p>\n<p>When Facebook launched Gifts in September, it only gave a few users beta access, but allowed the service to grow organically so anyone who received a Gift gained the ability to give them. It dropped another couple tens of millions of users into Gifts in late November, and now is finally publicly available so anyone in the US can give to other people stateside.</p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them. If it made $510 million a year, that would be $3 per year in additional average revenue per user in the US. That would nearly double the US ARPU from $3.4o to $6.40.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally — something it hasn’t announced any plans to do. But there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year. That’s a big hurdle for Gifts. Even if Facebook takes off in Facebook’s core markets like the UK, Germany, and Japan, it can’t scale to countries like Brazil and India.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been rapidly expanding the selection of what you can give. Today brings a whole new wine category plus new charitable organizations. A few weeks ago it added iTunes Gift Cards, and before that dozens of additional retailers to build on the 100+ it started with at the beginning of September when Gifts launched.</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy. By combining web and mobile advertising, payments taxes, and commerce instead of relying on just one, it has the flexibility to tune up or down how aggressively it monetizes each channel and hedges its risk. If it can stack enough $500 million a year revenue sources and then keeps growing them, it could keep its stock price rising or at least grow into a more comfortable earnings multiple.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:28 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts From Beta To All US Users.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:32 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:32 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", "bcf6f4d0-25d6-0130-e0a1-34159e126286"]]

The goal for Speek is to instead make the experience super simple for people and provide a high quality call.</p>\n<p>Speek hopes to disrupt the market with a service that gives each customer a unique web address of their choosing. The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved. Data can also be shared.</p>\n<p>Bracken said they have had 50 to 100 people on the platform at any one time but it’s best suited for ten to 15 people.</p>\n<p>Speek hosts its service on the backbone of the Level3 fiber network.</p>\n<p>Speek will compete in the $3 billion audio conference market  and by extension the $20 to $25 billion unified communications market. Competitors are GoToMeeting, WebEx and really any service that gives out a 10-digit number and a pin.</p>\n<p>In beta since June, the service is intended for small businesses or the person in a large business who wants an alternatieve to traditional conference calls.</p>\n<p>I like this service. It lacks the collaboration features of web conferencing services but I expect that will come. The team is strong. Bracken is one of the co-founders of Evite.com, which sold to Ticketmaster in 2001. Danny Boice is the CTO. He is the  founder of Jaxara, which sold to Pantheon in 2006.</p>\n<p>Speek makes the conference call experience much more pleasant. I do a lot of conference calls.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Blog to discuss it. Brand new versions of Yahoo! Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:37 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv. According to Efrat, Forexpros.com, which was founded in 2007, was averaging 3.6 million unique users per month before the company decided to go big and re-brand under Investing.com.</p>\n<p>“We are thrilled to launch investing.com today and believe that with our streaming real-time data, powerful analysis tools and great interface we can become a preeminent financial portal for novice and semi-professional investors and traders,” Efrat tells TechCrunch.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:39 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Top Domains: Forexpros Buys Investing.com For $2.45M, Launches One-Stop Financial Portal For Everyday Investors"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:39 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/8ejQD4-V0Yo/"], ["uuid", "c15ddb10-25d6-0130-e0a6-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Google may be the world’s largest mobile advertising company, but when it comes to devices that are driving the most advertising activity, it’s iOS and not Google’s Android that seems to set the heart racing. According to mobile browser and advertising company Opera Software, iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad continue to command the most usage among consumers.</p>\n<p>In the company’s latest State of Mobile Advertising survey, which analyses activity on Opera’s network of 10,000 mobile sites and some 40 billion monthly impressions globally, iOS devices collectively accounted for 44% of all ad impressions. Android devices, meanwhile, accounted for 26% of impressions.</p>\n<p>Opera notes two trends that have continued to keep Apple’s mobile platform in the lead when it comes to mobile ads.</p>\n<p>The first is the popularity of the iPhone 5. Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:42 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:42 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "c2367430-25d6-0130-e0a7-34159e126286"]]

A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Adobe is hosting an event today to show off some new updates it’s making for its Creative Cloud offerings, but here’s an advance look: The service is getting a number of exclusive updates that seem clearly designed to paint it as the upgrade path of choice, vs. the boxed and digital on-time software licensing fees that creative pros have used to get access to products like Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator in the past. New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on 200,000 paying subscribers during the first four months of availability (the most recent numbers can’t be released just yet), 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn.

It just wanted to know what was happening.</p>\n<p>I would like to humbly submit this for tweet of the year, which happened only last night:</p>\n Bummer my Instagram photo didn't show up on Twitter (Systrom Failure?)— Biz Stone (@biz) December 11, 2012 \n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 21, 2006\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $1.16B\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Created in 2006, Twitter is a global real-time communications platform with 400 million monthly visitors to twitter.com, more than 140 monthly active users around the world.\nWe see a billion tweets every 2.5 days on every conceivable topic.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Back in September 2011, Farmigo took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt and launched its site for discovering and enrolling in Community Supported Agriculture programs (where you can sign up to receive boxes of fresh produce from local farms). Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital. The company has now raised a total of $10 million.</p>\n<p>Carrot.is/Harvesting from Carrot Creative on Vimeo.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n August 2009\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $2M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Farmigo is providing an alternative food system by enabling group-buying of fresh food directly from local farms &amp; producers, making it convenient and affordable to get local, seasonal food.\nA grassroots food movement has been driving the popularity of Farmerâ€™s Markets and CSA programs (Community Supported Agriculture).

An Israeli app developer reckons there’s room for one more way to exchange messages, which combines the urgency of a voice with the convenience of text.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is an Android app (free to download from Google Play) that lets you respond to an incoming voice call by sending a text message or emoticon/symbol, instead of answering the call.  It also includes a ‘can you talk’ button that pings your contact to check whether they are free for a call before dialing their number – so you know whether or not to make the call in the first place.</p>\n<p>The broad-brush idea here is that you don’t always have time to answer a call – but you don’t necessarily want to flat-out reject the call since doing that is not necessarily a nuanced enough response for today’s hyper sophisticated mobile communicators.</p>\n<p>Text missives can be chosen from a list of stock phrases such as ‘Hi, what’s up?’ or ‘Getting back you’, which are pigeon-holed into basic categories like ‘work’, ‘pleasure’, ‘casual’ and ‘love’ for quick reference. You can also compose your own missives in real-time within the app so you can respond in more detail.  The point, in the app maker’s words, is to establish “the agenda of the call” before you start doing any actual talking.</p>\n<p>SayWhat also puts a lot of emphasis on fun – hence the addition of emoticons/symbols to the mix – which the developer describes as “a proven market for teenagers worldwide”.</p>\n<p>Now, before I go any further, it’s worth pointing out that Android 4.0 (and above) includes a feature – called Quick Response – that lets you respond to an incoming call with a ‘here’s one I made earlier’ pre-written text message. Which does rather steal some of SayWhat’s thunder. Presumably the app maker is hoping to add more value in its offering – by pimping it out with flourishes such as the aforementioned emoticons and categories — so you can respond to a call from your boss with a winking smilie (if you dare).</p>\n<p>Asked how it plans to distinguish its app from Android’s built-in text call reject feature, SayWhat sends me an email saying: “We’ll get back to you shortly” – so you can’t accuse them of not practising the text-based holding responses they are preaching. And indeed, they are true to their word, responding at length later to explain that their app empowers the caller by letting them find out what a call is about before they decide to answer it.</p>\n<p>“The SayWhat app adds a completely new dimension for the recipient. While you can text back with a response through a reject with a call text option, until now, you had to answer the call to find out what it’s about. The biggest value add of the app is for the recipient who now can see what the call is about before they answer it, helping to set the agenda (similar to an email subject line),” says the app maker’s CEO.  “The use cases for the app are endless. (Just think how many times are you in a meeting and the phone keeps ringing and ringing and you don’t know whether it’s an emergency or if your husband is just calling to see what’s for dinner). SayWhat answers that critical question of why someone is calling.”</p>\n<p>Moving beyond Android’s Quick Response feature, any smartphone user can of course effect a fairly similar outcome — by rejecting an incoming call and then sending an SMS to that person straight afterwards.  Or by using IM before making a call to find out if the person is free to talk. But SayWhat’s system cuts out a few steps since you can simultaneously text the caller from the call screen – thereby making it that little bit simpler to make your communications that little bit more convoluted. That, as they say, is progress.</p>\n<p>The person calling you doesn’t need to have SayWhat installed to view your ‘I can’t take your call right now but I still &lt;3 you’ missive – if they don’t have the app they’ll get your text response by SMS.  Presumably some of the more obscure symbols won’t necessarily translate to text though. “The best user experience is achieved when both sides have the app,” the CEO tells me.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the SMS response instance, there isn’t a massive difference between that and the manual method any old smartphone user can perform – i.e. pressing call reject, then composing an SMS to the caller to ask what they want — but with SayWhat you’re likely to gain a few seconds since it can all be done from within the same app.</p>\n<p>SayWhat’s CEO, Noam Wolf, disagrees that the difference between his app and IMing/manually texting someone who wants to speak to you is fairly incremental. “IM/SMS + call are two separate processes managed by two separate apps. SayWhat utilizes the Android call layer and open XMPP protocol to create the Enhanced Call Information (ECI) technology.  By bringing Enhanced Call Information (ECI) into the call we’re creating the call metadata,” he writes in an email.</p>\n<p>The wider point, though, is that being able to incorporate a little text-based, emoticon strewn back-and-forth prior to a call makes for a richer, overall communications experience – and allows people to understand the basic intent behind the call before the fact.</p>\n<p>“Text and emoticons (as well as caller information and photo if available) can play an important role before the call (pick up or reject), during and after the call (call log to remind you what you talked about at a specific date/time),” Wolf argues, stressing again that rival text-message-to-call-reject apps don’t include the option to reply by emoticon.</p>\n<p>You could say a key plank of SayWhat’s mission is to ‘verbify’ emoticons. “The real added value is in the caller side, being able to call and text (or emoticon) together and, for the recipient, they can know what the call is about before they answer it,” he says. “Another unique functionality is the exclusive ‘can you talk’ button, allowing the caller to know if the recipient is available for discussion even before making the call.”</p>\n<p>Wolf and the rest of the team behind SayWhat describe themselves as “veterans of the mobile industry”. Wolf has apparently created “dozens” of mobile apps on the Israeli market — and sold his company to Walla, part of Israeli comms company Bezeq Group.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is currently free to download and will remain so in future, says Wolf. Their business model focuses on charging for “premium content” – such as “emoticon packs” and “predefined sets of messages”. “One of the directions we plan to go is a festive holiday edition with predefined messages for Xmas, Valentines, Independence Day etc, assuming that a lot of the calls going out in the holiday season are for holiday best wishes or even offering company logos,” Wolf adds.</p>\n<p>They also plan to expand the app’s platform support in future – with iOS and Windows Phones the next two target OSes. The current SayWhat Android app is available in English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian Korean, Japanese, traditional and simplified Chinese and Hebrew flavours.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:53 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SayWhat App Helps You Find Out What A Caller Wants Before Picking Up The Phone"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:53 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/tNse-BRElB0/"], ["uuid", "c9e1e700-25d6-0130-e0ae-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Toronto-based SPOKEnPHOTO launched with a simple concept in mind: to help families and loved ones separated by geography stay connected via not only shared images, but also voice recordings attached to those pictures to help better tell a story. The startup launched an iPhone app in June, but co-founder Lynne McEachern told me the iPad app, which launches today, was always in the cards, but the company wanted to get the basic product and backend right before jumping to the bigger screen.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO Album is like the iPhone version in every way, in terms of what you can do with it. You can snap photos or take them from your library, and share them with friends and family. Sharing happens asynchronously, so that family members don’t have to be up and awake at the same time to connect, and sharing is designed to be limited only to those you actually care about, rather than being more open by default, like other photo sharing services including Instagram.</p>\n<p>“Our original idea really wrapped around the iPad app, because we [McEachern and her husband] were having problems connecting with our long distance friends and family a couple of years ago when we had our twin boys,” she said. “We basically didn’t answer the phone for a whole year, and we were missing everyone’s voice. We were in contact through Facebook and email and everything, but it really wasn’t the same.”</p>\n<p>The iPhone app is still a useful component of the overall product, since it means that users can snap photos and record messages wherever they are, especially on the go when they might not have their iPad with them. But the iPad is clearly designed to be more about collecting, organizing and browsing through memories stored with the service. It features a bookshelf layout not unlike that found in Apple’s iBooks, where albums are stored. Users can organize their photos into custom albums, which use a drag-and-drop interface to help users quickly and easily create personalized layouts that look good even if the individual making them isn’t particularly creative.</p>\n<p>You can add voice to images within the app, just like in the iPhone, as well as view all your pictures in an automatically generated gallery view. Albums can be shared via email, Facebook and Twitter, and receiving parties don’t need to have the app installed, thanks to a web-based interface that lets them browse through photos and attached recorded messages.</p>\n<p>McEachern says that while the iPhone app has garnered only just under 5,000 downloads so far, she thinks the iPad app does a better job of getting the core concept across, and also helps the product stand out considerably from other image/voice combo mobile apps out there like Fotobabble (which now aims more at corporate customers). Both apps are and will remain free, with revenue possibilities coming through premium added services to be introduced later on, including physical printed albums of photos stored on the service that include hooks (like scannable codes) to bring up recorded voice messages attached to pictures.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO is self-funded for now, and McEachern says the company hopes to remain that way until it can implement its revenue plans and reach the break-even point. Early traction with the iPhone app hasn’t been amazing, but the iPad app is very well put together, and even leaving aside the added feature of voice recording, presents a more attractive and better executed photo album app than most other competitive offerings out there. Time will tell if making the leap to the tablet is the jumpstart needed to help SPOKEnPHOTO reach critical mass.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:55 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SPOKEnPHOTO Album Arrives On The iPad, Letting You Share Voice With Pictures And Organize Those Memories"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 15:38:55 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/J_HsiMpgXbI/"], ["uuid", "cabe01b0-25d6-0130-e0af-34159e126286"]]

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”\nAbout Blake Irving\nBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.\nIrving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo!

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Now it’s time to see if Facebook Gifts will be a nice supplement to the company’s revenue, or a core chunk of it. Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential.</p>\n<p>Facebook launched its social commerce product Gifts in September. It lets people choose a friend, often someone who’s birthday or wedding it is, and give them a real-life gift or gift card. At first it only allowed a few users to access the beta, but then let the service grow organically so anyone who received a Gift gained the ability to give them. It dropped another couple tens of millions of users into Gifts in late November, and now is finally publicly available so anyone in the US can give to other people stateside.</p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them. If it made $510 million a year, that would be $3 per year in additional average revenue per user in the US. That would nearly double the US ARPU from $3.4o to $6.40.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally — something it hasn’t announced any plans to do. But there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year. That’s a big hurdle for Gifts. Even if Facebook takes off in Facebook’s core markets like the UK, Germany, and Japan, it can’t scale to countries like Brazil and India.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been rapidly expanding the selection of what you can give. Today brings a whole new wine category plus new charitable organizations. A few weeks ago it added iTunes Gift Cards, and before that dozens of additional retailers to build on the 100+ it started with when Gifts launched.</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy. By combining web and mobile advertising, payments taxes, and commerce instead of relying on just one, it has the flexibility to tune up or down how aggressively it monetizes each channel and hedges its risk. If it can stack enough $500 million a year revenue sources and then keeps growing them, it could keep its stock price rising or at least grow into a more comfortable earnings multiple.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:20 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts From Beta To All US Users.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:23 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:23 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", "7da386a0-25da-0130-e0b5-34159e126286"]]

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Blog to discuss it. Brand new versions of Yahoo! Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Evertale, a Copenhagen-based startup originally focused on creating an automatic log of your life, including everything from phone calls to checkins to photos taken, is pivoting. Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:29 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

Picking up a name that’s easy to remember can be a boon for traffic and can add a little brand protection to a company’s arsenal. While big purchases often go unreported, top domain names have been known to fetch a high price, with “insure.com” and “sex.com” ranking as the highest on record at $16 million and $13 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Today, we can add another one to the list, as financial website Forexpros.com has purchased “Investing.com” for $2.45 million, making it the largest (known) purchase of a single domain name in 2012. Until today, dudu.com and personalloans.com ranked the highest, each selling for an estimated $1 million. According to Domaining.com, the sale puts Investing.com among the top 26 or so domain names purchased, right between coupons.com and tom.com. The largest known sale of 2011? Why that would be the purchase of social.com by Salesforce.com, of course.</p>\n<p>With the purchase, Forexpros will today launch a global financial portal under the Investing.com URL, where it plans to offer a free resource for novice and semi-professional traders and investors to find realtime quotes and charts, breaking news, financial tools, technical analysis and calendars.</p>\n<p>According to Forexpros founder and CEO Dror Efrat, the site will service all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, futures and Forex. As to why the company decided to shell out $2.45 million for the purchase? Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv. According to Efrat, Forexpros.com, which was founded in 2007, was averaging 3.6 million unique users per month before the company decided to go big and re-brand under Investing.com.</p>\n<p>“We are thrilled to launch investing.com today and believe that with our streaming real-time data, powerful analysis tools and great interface we can become a preeminent financial portal for novice and semi-professional investors and traders,” Efrat tells TechCrunch.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:31 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Top Domains: Forexpros Buys Investing.com For $2.45M, Launches One-Stop Financial Portal For Everyday Investors"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:31 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/8ejQD4-V0Yo/"], ["uuid", "820dbde0-25da-0130-e0ba-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Google may be the world’s largest mobile advertising company, but when it comes to devices that are driving the most advertising activity, it’s iOS and not Google’s Android that seems to set the heart racing. According to mobile browser and advertising company Opera Software, iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad continue to command the most usage among consumers.</p>\n<p>In the company’s latest State of Mobile Advertising survey, which analyses activity on Opera’s network of 10,000 mobile sites and some 40 billion monthly impressions globally, iOS devices collectively accounted for 44% of all ad impressions. Android devices, meanwhile, accounted for 26% of impressions.</p>\n<p>Opera notes two trends that have continued to keep Apple’s mobile platform in the lead when it comes to mobile ads.</p>\n<p>The first is the popularity of the iPhone 5. Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:33 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:33 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "832f2b30-25da-0130-e0bb-34159e126286"]]

A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Adobe is hosting an event today to show off some new updates it’s making for its Creative Cloud offerings, but here’s an advance look: The service is getting a number of exclusive updates that seem clearly designed to paint it as the upgrade path of choice, vs. the boxed and digital on-time software licensing fees that creative pros have used to get access to products like Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator in the past. New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on around 326,000 paying subscribers out of a total of 1 million Creative Cloud members, around 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn. WebMD reported a net loss of $900K on the quarter, compared to positive income of $14.2 million during the same quarter last year. Still, its site traffic continues to grow, according to its quarterly financials, with 22 and 24 percent increases for unique visitors per month and page views between Q3 2011 and Q3 2012. So what’s behind the losses and the resulting need for budget cuts?</p>\n<p>Despite a growing audience, it seems like advertisers are either less interested or less able to create campaigns on WebMD. That may in part be because of patents being up for a number of brand-name drugs put out by major pharmaceutical brands like Pfizer and others which happened in 2012, reports the Atlanta Business Chronicle, and it could also have to do with new, tighter regulations on how those companies are allowed to advertise their wares introduced this past year.</p>\n<p>WebMD CEO Cavan Redmond defended the decision in a statement in today’s press release, alluding only to greater competition in the space, but not offering any firm explanation of what exactly led to the losses and subsequent decision:</p>\n WebMD’s value proposition for users continues to be very strong.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Back in September 2011, Farmigo took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt and launched its site for discovering and enrolling in Community Supported Agriculture programs (where you can sign up to receive boxes of fresh produce from local farms). Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital.

An Israeli app developer reckons there’s room for one more way to exchange messages, which combines the urgency of a voice with the convenience of text.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is an Android app (free to download from Google Play) that lets you respond to an incoming voice call by sending a text message or emoticon/symbol, instead of answering the call.  It also includes a ‘can you talk’ button that pings your contact to check whether they are free for a call before dialing their number – so you know whether or not to make the call in the first place.</p>\n<p>The broad-brush idea here is that you don’t always have time to answer a call – but you don’t necessarily want to flat-out reject the call since doing that is not necessarily a nuanced enough response for today’s hyper sophisticated mobile communicators.</p>\n<p>Text missives can be chosen from a list of stock phrases such as ‘Hi, what’s up?’ or ‘Getting back you’, which are pigeon-holed into basic categories like ‘work’, ‘pleasure’, ‘casual’ and ‘love’ for quick reference. You can also compose your own missives in real-time within the app so you can respond in more detail.  The point, in the app maker’s words, is to establish “the agenda of the call” before you start doing any actual talking.</p>\n<p>SayWhat also puts a lot of emphasis on fun – hence the addition of emoticons/symbols to the mix – which the developer describes as “a proven market for teenagers worldwide”.</p>\n<p>Now, before I go any further, it’s worth pointing out that Android 4.0 (and above) includes a feature – called Quick Response – that lets you respond to an incoming call with a ‘here’s one I made earlier’ pre-written text message. Which does rather steal some of SayWhat’s thunder. Presumably the app maker is hoping to add more value in its offering – by pimping it out with flourishes such as the aforementioned emoticons and categories — so you can respond to a call from your boss with a winking smilie (if you dare).</p>\n<p>Asked how it plans to distinguish its app from Android’s built-in text call reject feature, SayWhat sends me an email saying: “We’ll get back to you shortly” – so you can’t accuse them of not practising the text-based holding responses they are preaching. And indeed, they are true to their word, responding at length later to explain that their app empowers the caller by letting them find out what a call is about before they decide to answer it.</p>\n<p>“The SayWhat app adds a completely new dimension for the recipient. While you can text back with a response through a reject with a call text option, until now, you had to answer the call to find out what it’s about. The biggest value add of the app is for the recipient who now can see what the call is about before they answer it, helping to set the agenda (similar to an email subject line),” says the app maker’s CEO.  “The use cases for the app are endless. (Just think how many times are you in a meeting and the phone keeps ringing and ringing and you don’t know whether it’s an emergency or if your husband is just calling to see what’s for dinner). SayWhat answers that critical question of why someone is calling.”</p>\n<p>Moving beyond Android’s Quick Response feature, any smartphone user can of course effect a fairly similar outcome — by rejecting an incoming call and then sending an SMS to that person straight afterwards.  Or by using IM before making a call to find out if the person is free to talk. But SayWhat’s system cuts out a few steps since you can simultaneously text the caller from the call screen – thereby making it that little bit simpler to make your communications that little bit more convoluted. That, as they say, is progress.</p>\n<p>The person calling you doesn’t need to have SayWhat installed to view your ‘I can’t take your call right now but I still &lt;3 you’ missive – if they don’t have the app they’ll get your text response by SMS.  Presumably some of the more obscure symbols won’t necessarily translate to text though. “The best user experience is achieved when both sides have the app,” the CEO tells me.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the SMS response instance, there isn’t a massive difference between that and the manual method any old smartphone user can perform – i.e. pressing call reject, then composing an SMS to the caller to ask what they want — but with SayWhat you’re likely to gain a few seconds since it can all be done from within the same app.</p>\n<p>SayWhat’s CEO, Noam Wolf, disagrees that the difference between his app and IMing/manually texting someone who wants to speak to you is fairly incremental. “IM/SMS + call are two separate processes managed by two separate apps. SayWhat utilizes the Android call layer and open XMPP protocol to create the Enhanced Call Information (ECI) technology.  By bringing Enhanced Call Information (ECI) into the call we’re creating the call metadata,” he writes in an email.</p>\n<p>The wider point, though, is that being able to incorporate a little text-based, emoticon strewn back-and-forth prior to a call makes for a richer, overall communications experience – and allows people to understand the basic intent behind the call before the fact.</p>\n<p>“Text and emoticons (as well as caller information and photo if available) can play an important role before the call (pick up or reject), during and after the call (call log to remind you what you talked about at a specific date/time),” Wolf argues, stressing again that rival text-message-to-call-reject apps don’t include the option to reply by emoticon.</p>\n<p>You could say a key plank of SayWhat’s mission is to ‘verbify’ emoticons. “The real added value is in the caller side, being able to call and text (or emoticon) together and, for the recipient, they can know what the call is about before they answer it,” he says. “Another unique functionality is the exclusive ‘can you talk’ button, allowing the caller to know if the recipient is available for discussion even before making the call.”</p>\n<p>Wolf and the rest of the team behind SayWhat describe themselves as “veterans of the mobile industry”. Wolf has apparently created “dozens” of mobile apps on the Israeli market — and sold his company to Walla, part of Israeli comms company Bezeq Group.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is currently free to download and will remain so in future, says Wolf. Their business model focuses on charging for “premium content” – such as “emoticon packs” and “predefined sets of messages”. “One of the directions we plan to go is a festive holiday edition with predefined messages for Xmas, Valentines, Independence Day etc, assuming that a lot of the calls going out in the holiday season are for holiday best wishes or even offering company logos,” Wolf adds.</p>\n<p>They also plan to expand the app’s platform support in future – with iOS and Windows Phones the next two target OSes. The current SayWhat Android app is available in English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian Korean, Japanese, traditional and simplified Chinese and Hebrew flavours.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:43 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SayWhat App Helps You Find Out What A Caller Wants Before Picking Up The Phone"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:43 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/tNse-BRElB0/"], ["uuid", "899f6350-25da-0130-e0c2-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Toronto-based SPOKEnPHOTO launched with a simple concept in mind: to help families and loved ones separated by geography stay connected via not only shared images, but also voice recordings attached to those pictures to help better tell a story. The startup launched an iPhone app in June, but co-founder Lynne McEachern told me the iPad app, which launches today, was always in the cards, but the company wanted to get the basic product and backend right before jumping to the bigger screen.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO Album is like the iPhone version in every way, in terms of what you can do with it. You can snap photos or take them from your library, and share them with friends and family. Sharing happens asynchronously, so that family members don’t have to be up and awake at the same time to connect, and sharing is designed to be limited only to those you actually care about, rather than being more open by default, like other photo sharing services including Instagram.</p>\n<p>“Our original idea really wrapped around the iPad app, because we [McEachern and her husband] were having problems connecting with our long distance friends and family a couple of years ago when we had our twin boys,” she said. “We basically didn’t answer the phone for a whole year, and we were missing everyone’s voice. We were in contact through Facebook and email and everything, but it really wasn’t the same.”</p>\n<p>The iPhone app is still a useful component of the overall product, since it means that users can snap photos and record messages wherever they are, especially on the go when they might not have their iPad with them. But the iPad is clearly designed to be more about collecting, organizing and browsing through memories stored with the service. It features a bookshelf layout not unlike that found in Apple’s iBooks, where albums are stored. Users can organize their photos into custom albums, which use a drag-and-drop interface to help users quickly and easily create personalized layouts that look good even if the individual making them isn’t particularly creative.</p>\n<p>You can add voice to images within the app, just like in the iPhone, as well as view all your pictures in an automatically generated gallery view. Albums can be shared via email, Facebook and Twitter, and receiving parties don’t need to have the app installed, thanks to a web-based interface that lets them browse through photos and attached recorded messages.</p>\n<p>McEachern says that while the iPhone app has garnered only just under 5,000 downloads so far, she thinks the iPad app does a better job of getting the core concept across, and also helps the product stand out considerably from other image/voice combo mobile apps out there like Fotobabble (which now aims more at corporate customers). Both apps are and will remain free, with revenue possibilities coming through premium added services to be introduced later on, including physical printed albums of photos stored on the service that include hooks (like scannable codes) to bring up recorded voice messages attached to pictures.</p>\n<p>SPOKEnPHOTO is self-funded for now, and McEachern says the company hopes to remain that way until it can implement its revenue plans and reach the break-even point. Early traction with the iPhone app hasn’t been amazing, but the iPad app is very well put together, and even leaving aside the added feature of voice recording, presents a more attractive and better executed photo album app than most other competitive offerings out there. Time will tell if making the leap to the tablet is the jumpstart needed to help SPOKEnPHOTO reach critical mass.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:45 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SPOKEnPHOTO Album Arrives On The iPad, Letting You Share Voice With Pictures And Organize Those Memories"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:05:45 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/J_HsiMpgXbI/"], ["uuid", "8a892460-25da-0130-e0c3-34159e126286"]]

At the time, the company noted that this latest big sweep would mainly affect those with larger follower counts, or those who had purchased fake followers. The majority (99 percent) of users would lose fewer than 10 followers, Pinterest said. Today, we have some figures on what those drops looked like, at least in terms of their affect on top Pinterest accounts.</p>\n<p>According to Lyle Dennis, co-creator of Pinterest user directory Top Pinterest Users, the top 10 most followed Pinterest users saw around a 20 percent decline in follower numbers immediately after the Pinterest purge. For example, the top Pinterest user (Joy Cho / Oh Joy!) had 12 million-plus followers before the clean out, and dropped to under 10 million afterwards. She has since gained again, and as of today sits at 10,124,648 followers.</p>\n<p>Dennis says he didn’t keep historical data on-hand for the larger Pinterest user base – he just happened to have noticed the changes thanks to a screencap of the Pinterest top 10 which was posted to a social media news blog just before the spam crackdown.</p>\n<p>Looking at the numbers again today, which have climbed again for some users since the purge, you can see that the event impacted the rankings, and even booted one user out of the top 10 entirely. Here’s how the numbers have changed for those users before and after the clean out:</p>\n<p>Before:</p>\n Joy Cho/ Oh Joy!: 12,733,689\nBekka Palmer: 8,465,927\nMaryann Rizzo: 8,073,270\nBonnie Tsang: 7,889,295\nJane Wang:  7,514,671\npejper:  6,826,436\nmolly pickering:  6,786,757\nJan of Poppytalk: 6,703,051\nHonestlyWTF: 5,483,892\nOlya Bastet: 5,162,212\n <p>After (as of today):</p>\n Joy Cho/ Oh Joy!: 10,124,648\nJane Wang:  6,876,464\nBekka Palmer: 6,785,853\nMaryann Rizzo: 6,742,899\nBonnie Tsang: 5,911,135\nmolly pickering: 5,435,822\nJan of Poppytalk:  5,410,144\npejper:  5,057,767\nHonestlyWTF:  4,392,324\nChristine Martinez: 4,255,261\n <p>Note that these “after” numbers are current as of today – at the time when Dennis reported the immediate effects to us, some of the after numbers were even lower, with declines falling into a 20-25 percent range, depending on the user.</p>\n<p>Although the purge likely did only impact these larger user accounts to this extent, it’s a notable sweep, as the website itself only has around 40 million users globally, according to November numbers from comScore.</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, the Top Pinterest Users website, also built by Hugo Gameiro, continually checks the top users and boards on Pinterest to ensure its numbers are accurate. However, it does so without using an official API, as Pinterest has not yet released an API publicly at this time. The site also organizes users into various categories, like WeFellow did back in Twitter’s earlier days.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:12:17 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Roughly 20 Percent Of Pinterest’s Top 10 Users’ Followers Were Spammers And Fake Accounts"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:12:17 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/yv7iXKIZGv4/"], ["uuid", "7449b4c0-25db-0130-e0c4-34159e126286"]]

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”\nAbout Blake Irving\nBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.\nIrving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo! Incorporated, where he developed and rolled out the unified product vision and strategy – growing the company to nearly one billion active PC and mobile users.  Prior to Yahoo, he spent 15 years at Microsoft, serving in various senior roles, most recently as Corporate Vice President of the Windows Live Platform.  While at Microsoft, Irving was responsible for creating and leading a global development and operations organization of more than 4,000 employees in the creation and operation of Microsoft’s global online services, launching several new products, including MSN Messenger and growing Hotmail from 7 million to 290 million users.\nMr. Irving currently serves on the Board of GolfLogix, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based mobile Web company.  He has also served as a professor at Pepperdine University.  He is a graduate of San Diego State and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. \n<p>Photo Flickr</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:12:21 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "GoDaddy Doubles Down On Product With A New CEO: Ex-Yahoo Product Chief Blake Irving"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:12:21 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/4MbZu2aa8_s/"], ["uuid", "76798f90-25db-0130-e0c6-34159e126286"]]

Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential.</p>\n<p>Facebook launched its social commerce product Gifts in September. It lets people choose a friend, often someone who’s birthday or wedding it is, and give them a real-life gift or gift card. At first it only allowed a few users to access the beta, but then let the service grow organically so anyone who received a Gift gained the ability to give them. It dropped another couple tens of millions of users into Gifts in late November, and now is finally publicly available so anyone in the US can give to other people stateside.</p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them. If it made $510 million a year, that would be $3 per year in additional average revenue per user in the US. That would nearly double the US ARPU from $3.4o to $6.40.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally — something it hasn’t announced any plans to do. But there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year. That’s a big hurdle for Gifts. Even if Facebook takes off in Facebook’s core markets like the UK, Germany, and Japan, it can’t scale to countries like Brazil and India.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been rapidly expanding the selection of what you can give. Today brings a whole new wine category plus new charitable organizations. A few weeks ago it added iTunes Gift Cards, and before that dozens of additional retailers to build on the 100+ it started with when Gifts launched.</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy. By combining web and mobile advertising, payments taxes, and commerce instead of relying on just one, it has the flexibility to tune up or down how aggressively it monetizes each channel and hedges its risk. If it can stack enough $500 million a year revenue sources and then keeps growing them, it could keep its stock price rising or at least grow into a more comfortable earnings multiple.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:12:24 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts From Beta To All US Users.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year.

Investors were not disclosed. Previous investors have included the CIT Gap Funds, a family of seed- and early-stage investment funds placing near-equity and equity investments in Virginia-based technology, life science, and cleantech companies.</p>\n<p>As Co-Founder and CEO John Bracken explains it, Speek was invented because the user conference call experience is awful and antiquated. The goal for Speek is to instead make the experience super simple for people and provide a high quality call.</p>\n<p>Speek hopes to disrupt the market with a service that gives each customer a unique web address of their choosing. The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved. Data can also be shared.</p>\n<p>Bracken said they have had 50 to 100 people on the platform at any one time but it’s best suited for ten to 15 people.</p>\n<p>Speek hosts its service on the backbone of the Level3 fiber network.</p>\n<p>Speek will compete in the $3 billion audio conference market  and by extension the $20 to $25 billion unified communications market. Competitors are GoToMeeting, WebEx and really any service that gives out a 10-digit number and a pin.</p>\n<p>In beta since June, the service is intended for small businesses or the person in a large business who wants an alternatieve to traditional conference calls.</p>\n<p>I like this service. It lacks the collaboration features of web conferencing services but I expect that will come. The team is strong. Bracken is one of the co-founders of Evite.com, which sold to Ticketmaster in 2001. Danny Boice is the CTO. He is the  founder of Jaxara, which sold to Pantheon in 2006.</p>\n<p>Speek makes the conference call experience much more pleasant. I do a lot of conference calls. The number, the pass code and all the audio prompts are maddening. You never know who is speaking.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:12:34 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

Picking up a name that’s easy to remember can be a boon for traffic and can add a little brand protection to a company’s arsenal. While big purchases often go unreported, top domain names have been known to fetch a high price, with “insure.com” and “sex.com” ranking as the highest on record at $16 million and $13 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Today, we can add another one to the list, as financial website Forexpros.com has purchased “Investing.com” for $2.45 million, making it the largest (known) purchase of a single domain name in 2012. Until today, dudu.com and personalloans.com ranked the highest, each selling for an estimated $1 million. According to Domaining.com, the sale puts Investing.com among the top 26 or so domain names purchased, right between coupons.com and tom.com. The largest known sale of 2011? Why that would be the purchase of social.com by Salesforce.com, of course.</p>\n<p>With the purchase, Forexpros will today launch a global financial portal under the Investing.com URL, where it plans to offer a free resource for novice and semi-professional traders and investors to find realtime quotes and charts, breaking news, financial tools, technical analysis and calendars.</p>\n<p>According to Forexpros founder and CEO Dror Efrat, the site will service all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, futures and Forex. As to why the company decided to shell out $2.45 million for the purchase? Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv.

Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:12:37 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:12:37 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "805b4a30-25db-0130-e0d0-34159e126286"]]

A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on around 326,000 paying subscribers out of a total of 1 million Creative Cloud members, around 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn.

Still, its site traffic continues to grow, according to its quarterly financials, with 22 and 24 percent increases for unique visitors per month and page views between Q3 2011 and Q3 2012. So what’s behind the losses and the resulting need for budget cuts?</p>\n<p>Despite a growing audience, it seems like advertisers are either less interested or less able to create campaigns on WebMD. That may in part be because of patents being up for a number of brand-name drugs put out by major pharmaceutical brands like Pfizer and others which happened in 2012, reports the Atlanta Business Chronicle, and it could also have to do with new, tighter regulations on how those companies are allowed to advertise their wares introduced this past year.</p>\n<p>WebMD CEO Cavan Redmond defended the decision in a statement in today’s press release, alluding only to greater competition in the space, but not offering any firm explanation of what exactly led to the losses and subsequent decision:</p>\n WebMD’s value proposition for users continues to be very strong.

Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital.

Which does rather steal some of SayWhat’s thunder. Presumably the app maker is hoping to add more value in its offering – by pimping it out with flourishes such as the aforementioned emoticons and categories — so you can respond to a call from your boss with a winking smilie (if you dare).</p>\n<p>Asked how it plans to distinguish its app from Android’s built-in text call reject feature, SayWhat sends me an email saying: “We’ll get back to you shortly” – so you can’t accuse them of not practising the text-based holding responses they are preaching. And indeed, they are true to their word, responding at length later to explain that their app empowers the caller by letting them find out what a call is about before they decide to answer it.</p>\n<p>“The SayWhat app adds a completely new dimension for the recipient. While you can text back with a response through a reject with a call text option, until now, you had to answer the call to find out what it’s about. The biggest value add of the app is for the recipient who now can see what the call is about before they answer it, helping to set the agenda (similar to an email subject line),” says the app maker’s CEO.  “The use cases for the app are endless. (Just think how many times are you in a meeting and the phone keeps ringing and ringing and you don’t know whether it’s an emergency or if your husband is just calling to see what’s for dinner). SayWhat answers that critical question of why someone is calling.”</p>\n<p>Moving beyond Android’s Quick Response feature, any smartphone user can of course effect a fairly similar outcome — by rejecting an incoming call and then sending an SMS to that person straight afterwards.  Or by using IM before making a call to find out if the person is free to talk. But SayWhat’s system cuts out a few steps since you can simultaneously text the caller from the call screen – thereby making it that little bit simpler to make your communications that little bit more convoluted. That, as they say, is progress.</p>\n<p>The person calling you doesn’t need to have SayWhat installed to view your ‘I can’t take your call right now but I still &lt;3 you’ missive – if they don’t have the app they’ll get your text response by SMS.  Presumably some of the more obscure symbols won’t necessarily translate to text though. “The best user experience is achieved when both sides have the app,” the CEO tells me.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the SMS response instance, there isn’t a massive difference between that and the manual method any old smartphone user can perform – i.e. pressing call reject, then composing an SMS to the caller to ask what they want — but with SayWhat you’re likely to gain a few seconds since it can all be done from within the same app.</p>\n<p>SayWhat’s CEO, Noam Wolf, disagrees that the difference between his app and IMing/manually texting someone who wants to speak to you is fairly incremental. “IM/SMS + call are two separate processes managed by two separate apps. SayWhat utilizes the Android call layer and open XMPP protocol to create the Enhanced Call Information (ECI) technology.  By bringing Enhanced Call Information (ECI) into the call we’re creating the call metadata,” he writes in an email.</p>\n<p>The wider point, though, is that being able to incorporate a little text-based, emoticon strewn back-and-forth prior to a call makes for a richer, overall communications experience – and allows people to understand the basic intent behind the call before the fact.</p>\n<p>“Text and emoticons (as well as caller information and photo if available) can play an important role before the call (pick up or reject), during and after the call (call log to remind you what you talked about at a specific date/time),” Wolf argues, stressing again that rival text-message-to-call-reject apps don’t include the option to reply by emoticon.</p>\n<p>You could say a key plank of SayWhat’s mission is to ‘verbify’ emoticons. “The real added value is in the caller side, being able to call and text (or emoticon) together and, for the recipient, they can know what the call is about before they answer it,” he says. “Another unique functionality is the exclusive ‘can you talk’ button, allowing the caller to know if the recipient is available for discussion even before making the call.”</p>\n<p>Wolf and the rest of the team behind SayWhat describe themselves as “veterans of the mobile industry”. Wolf has apparently created “dozens” of mobile apps on the Israeli market — and sold his company to Walla, part of Israeli comms company Bezeq Group.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is currently free to download and will remain so in future, says Wolf. Their business model focuses on charging for “premium content” – such as “emoticon packs” and “predefined sets of messages”. “One of the directions we plan to go is a festive holiday edition with predefined messages for Xmas, Valentines, Independence Day etc, assuming that a lot of the calls going out in the holiday season are for holiday best wishes or even offering company logos,” Wolf adds.</p>\n<p>They also plan to expand the app’s platform support in future – with iOS and Windows Phones the next two target OSes. The current SayWhat Android app is available in English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian Korean, Japanese, traditional and simplified Chinese and Hebrew flavours.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:12:49 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SayWhat App Helps You Find Out What A Caller Wants Before Picking Up The Phone"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:12:49 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/tNse-BRElB0/"], ["uuid", "872d5dd0-25db-0130-e0d7-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Last week, Pinterest began curtailing the number of spammers and fake accounts on its system, in an effort to clear its platform off unwanted elements. At the time, the company noted that this latest big sweep would mainly affect those with larger follower counts, or those who had purchased fake followers. The majority (99 percent) of users would lose fewer than 10 followers, Pinterest said. Today, we have some figures on what those drops looked like, at least in terms of their affect on top Pinterest accounts.</p>\n<p>According to Lyle Dennis, co-creator of Pinterest user directory Top Pinterest Users, the top 10 most followed Pinterest users saw around a 20 percent decline in follower numbers immediately after the Pinterest purge. For example, the top Pinterest user (Joy Cho / Oh Joy!) had 12 million-plus followers before the clean out, and dropped to under 10 million afterwards. She has since gained again, and as of today sits at 10,124,648 followers.</p>\n<p>Dennis says he didn’t keep historical data on-hand for the larger Pinterest user base – he just happened to have noticed the changes thanks to a screencap of the Pinterest top 10 which was posted to a social media news blog just before the spam crackdown.</p>\n<p>Looking at the numbers again today, which have climbed again for some users since the purge, you can see that the event impacted the rankings, and even booted one user out of the top 10 entirely. Here’s how the numbers have changed for those users before and after the clean out:</p>\n<p>Before:</p>\n Joy Cho/ Oh Joy!: 12,733,689\nBekka Palmer: 8,465,927\nMaryann Rizzo: 8,073,270\nBonnie Tsang: 7,889,295\nJane Wang:  7,514,671\npejper:  6,826,436\nmolly pickering:  6,786,757\nJan of Poppytalk: 6,703,051\nHonestlyWTF: 5,483,892\nOlya Bastet: 5,162,212\n <p>After (as of today):</p>\n Joy Cho/ Oh Joy!: 10,124,648\nJane Wang:  6,876,464\nBekka Palmer: 6,785,853\nMaryann Rizzo: 6,742,899\nBonnie Tsang: 5,911,135\nmolly pickering: 5,435,822\nJan of Poppytalk:  5,410,144\npejper:  5,057,767\nHonestlyWTF:  4,392,324\nChristine Martinez: 4,255,261\n <p>Note that these “after” numbers are current as of today – at the time when Dennis reported the immediate effects to us, some of the after numbers were even lower, with declines falling into a 20-25 percent range, depending on the user.</p>\n<p>Although the purge likely did only impact these larger user accounts to this extent, it’s a notable sweep, as the website itself only has around 40 million users globally, according to November numbers from comScore.</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, the Top Pinterest Users website, also built by Hugo Gameiro, continually checks the top users and boards on Pinterest to ensure its numbers are accurate. However, it does so without using an official API, as Pinterest has not yet released an API publicly at this time. The site also organizes users into various categories, like WeFellow did back in Twitter’s earlier days.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:14:06 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Roughly 20 Percent Of Pinterest’s Top 10 Users’ Followers Were Spammers And Fake Accounts"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:14:06 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/yv7iXKIZGv4/"], ["uuid", "b5403cc0-25db-0130-e0d8-34159e126286"]]

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”\nAbout Blake Irving\nBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.\nIrving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo!

Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential.</p>\n<p>Facebook launched its social commerce product Gifts in September. It lets people choose a friend, often someone who’s birthday or wedding it is, and give them a real-life gift or gift card. At first it only allowed a few users to access the beta, but then let the service grow organically so anyone who received a Gift gained the ability to give them. It dropped another couple tens of millions of users into Gifts in late November, and now is finally publicly available so anyone in the US can give to other people stateside.</p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them. If it made $510 million a year, that would be $3 per year in additional average revenue per user in the US. That would nearly double the US ARPU from $3.4o to $6.40.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally — something it hasn’t announced any plans to do. But there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year. That’s a big hurdle for Gifts. Even if Facebook takes off in Facebook’s core markets like the UK, Germany, and Japan, it can’t scale to countries like Brazil and India.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been rapidly expanding the selection of what you can give. Today brings a whole new wine category plus new charitable organizations. A few weeks ago it added iTunes Gift Cards, and before that dozens of additional retailers to build on the 100+ it started with when Gifts launched.</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy. By combining web and mobile advertising, payments taxes, and commerce instead of relying on just one, it has the flexibility to tune up or down how aggressively it monetizes each channel and hedges its risk. If it can stack enough $500 million a year revenue sources and then keeps growing them, it could keep its stock price rising or at least grow into a more comfortable earnings multiple.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:14:13 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts From Beta To All US Users.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year.

Investors were not disclosed. Previous investors have included the CIT Gap Funds, a family of seed- and early-stage investment funds placing near-equity and equity investments in Virginia-based technology, life science, and cleantech companies.</p>\n<p>As Co-Founder and CEO John Bracken explains it, Speek was invented because the user conference call experience is awful and antiquated. The goal for Speek is to instead make the experience super simple for people and provide a high quality call.</p>\n<p>Speek hopes to disrupt the market with a service that gives each customer a unique web address of their choosing. The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved. Data can also be shared.</p>\n<p>Bracken said they have had 50 to 100 people on the platform at any one time but it’s best suited for ten to 15 people.</p>\n<p>Speek hosts its service on the backbone of the Level3 fiber network.</p>\n<p>Speek will compete in the $3 billion audio conference market  and by extension the $20 to $25 billion unified communications market. Competitors are GoToMeeting, WebEx and really any service that gives out a 10-digit number and a pin.</p>\n<p>In beta since June, the service is intended for small businesses or the person in a large business who wants an alternatieve to traditional conference calls.</p>\n<p>I like this service. It lacks the collaboration features of web conferencing services but I expect that will come. The team is strong. Bracken is one of the co-founders of Evite.com, which sold to Ticketmaster in 2001. Danny Boice is the CTO. He is the  founder of Jaxara, which sold to Pantheon in 2006.</p>\n<p>Speek makes the conference call experience much more pleasant. I do a lot of conference calls. The number, the pass code and all the audio prompts are maddening. You never know who is speaking.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:14:25 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

Picking up a name that’s easy to remember can be a boon for traffic and can add a little brand protection to a company’s arsenal. While big purchases often go unreported, top domain names have been known to fetch a high price, with “insure.com” and “sex.com” ranking as the highest on record at $16 million and $13 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Today, we can add another one to the list, as financial website Forexpros.com has purchased “Investing.com” for $2.45 million, making it the largest (known) purchase of a single domain name in 2012. Until today, dudu.com and personalloans.com ranked the highest, each selling for an estimated $1 million. According to Domaining.com, the sale puts Investing.com among the top 26 or so domain names purchased, right between coupons.com and tom.com. The largest known sale of 2011? Why that would be the purchase of social.com by Salesforce.com, of course.</p>\n<p>With the purchase, Forexpros will today launch a global financial portal under the Investing.com URL, where it plans to offer a free resource for novice and semi-professional traders and investors to find realtime quotes and charts, breaking news, financial tools, technical analysis and calendars.</p>\n<p>According to Forexpros founder and CEO Dror Efrat, the site will service all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, futures and Forex. As to why the company decided to shell out $2.45 million for the purchase? Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv.

Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:14:28 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:14:28 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "c25e4d10-25db-0130-e0e4-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Last December, Omada Health raised $800K in seed funding from a host of angel and venture investors, including NEA, Aberdare, Kapor Capital, TriplePoint Ventures and Esther Dyson — to name a few. A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on around 326,000 paying subscribers out of a total of 1 million Creative Cloud members, around 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn.

Still, its site traffic continues to grow, according to its quarterly financials, with 22 and 24 percent increases for unique visitors per month and page views between Q3 2011 and Q3 2012. So what’s behind the losses and the resulting need for budget cuts?</p>\n<p>Despite a growing audience, it seems like advertisers are either less interested or less able to create campaigns on WebMD. That may in part be because of patents being up for a number of brand-name drugs put out by major pharmaceutical brands like Pfizer and others which happened in 2012, reports the Atlanta Business Chronicle, and it could also have to do with new, tighter regulations on how those companies are allowed to advertise their wares introduced this past year.</p>\n<p>WebMD CEO Cavan Redmond defended the decision in a statement in today’s press release, alluding only to greater competition in the space, but not offering any firm explanation of what exactly led to the losses and subsequent decision:</p>\n WebMD’s value proposition for users continues to be very strong.

Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital.

You can also compose your own missives in real-time within the app so you can respond in more detail.  The point, in the app maker’s words, is to establish “the agenda of the call” before you start doing any actual talking.</p>\n<p>SayWhat also puts a lot of emphasis on fun – hence the addition of emoticons/symbols to the mix – which the developer describes as “a proven market for teenagers worldwide”.</p>\n<p>Now, before I go any further, it’s worth pointing out that Android 4.0 (and above) includes a feature – called Quick Response – that lets you respond to an incoming call with a ‘here’s one I made earlier’ pre-written text message. Which does rather steal some of SayWhat’s thunder. Presumably the app maker is hoping to add more value in its offering – by pimping it out with flourishes such as the aforementioned emoticons and categories — so you can respond to a call from your boss with a winking smilie (if you dare).</p>\n<p>Asked how it plans to distinguish its app from Android’s built-in text call reject feature, SayWhat sends me an email saying: “We’ll get back to you shortly” – so you can’t accuse them of not practising the text-based holding responses they are preaching. And indeed, they are true to their word, responding at length later to explain that their app empowers the caller by letting them find out what a call is about before they decide to answer it.</p>\n<p>“The SayWhat app adds a completely new dimension for the recipient. While you can text back with a response through a reject with a call text option, until now, you had to answer the call to find out what it’s about. The biggest value add of the app is for the recipient who now can see what the call is about before they answer it, helping to set the agenda (similar to an email subject line),” says the app maker’s CEO.  “The use cases for the app are endless. (Just think how many times are you in a meeting and the phone keeps ringing and ringing and you don’t know whether it’s an emergency or if your husband is just calling to see what’s for dinner). SayWhat answers that critical question of why someone is calling.”</p>\n<p>Moving beyond Android’s Quick Response feature, any smartphone user can of course effect a fairly similar outcome — by rejecting an incoming call and then sending an SMS to that person straight afterwards.  Or by using IM before making a call to find out if the person is free to talk. But SayWhat’s system cuts out a few steps since you can simultaneously text the caller from the call screen – thereby making it that little bit simpler to make your communications that little bit more convoluted. That, as they say, is progress.</p>\n<p>The person calling you doesn’t need to have SayWhat installed to view your ‘I can’t take your call right now but I still &lt;3 you’ missive – if they don’t have the app they’ll get your text response by SMS.  Presumably some of the more obscure symbols won’t necessarily translate to text though. “The best user experience is achieved when both sides have the app,” the CEO tells me.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the SMS response instance, there isn’t a massive difference between that and the manual method any old smartphone user can perform – i.e. pressing call reject, then composing an SMS to the caller to ask what they want — but with SayWhat you’re likely to gain a few seconds since it can all be done from within the same app.</p>\n<p>SayWhat’s CEO, Noam Wolf, disagrees that the difference between his app and IMing/manually texting someone who wants to speak to you is fairly incremental. “IM/SMS + call are two separate processes managed by two separate apps. SayWhat utilizes the Android call layer and open XMPP protocol to create the Enhanced Call Information (ECI) technology.  By bringing Enhanced Call Information (ECI) into the call we’re creating the call metadata,” he writes in an email.</p>\n<p>The wider point, though, is that being able to incorporate a little text-based, emoticon strewn back-and-forth prior to a call makes for a richer, overall communications experience – and allows people to understand the basic intent behind the call before the fact.</p>\n<p>“Text and emoticons (as well as caller information and photo if available) can play an important role before the call (pick up or reject), during and after the call (call log to remind you what you talked about at a specific date/time),” Wolf argues, stressing again that rival text-message-to-call-reject apps don’t include the option to reply by emoticon.</p>\n<p>You could say a key plank of SayWhat’s mission is to ‘verbify’ emoticons. “The real added value is in the caller side, being able to call and text (or emoticon) together and, for the recipient, they can know what the call is about before they answer it,” he says. “Another unique functionality is the exclusive ‘can you talk’ button, allowing the caller to know if the recipient is available for discussion even before making the call.”</p>\n<p>Wolf and the rest of the team behind SayWhat describe themselves as “veterans of the mobile industry”. Wolf has apparently created “dozens” of mobile apps on the Israeli market — and sold his company to Walla, part of Israeli comms company Bezeq Group.</p>\n<p>SayWhat is currently free to download and will remain so in future, says Wolf. Their business model focuses on charging for “premium content” – such as “emoticon packs” and “predefined sets of messages”. “One of the directions we plan to go is a festive holiday edition with predefined messages for Xmas, Valentines, Independence Day etc, assuming that a lot of the calls going out in the holiday season are for holiday best wishes or even offering company logos,” Wolf adds.</p>\n<p>They also plan to expand the app’s platform support in future – with iOS and Windows Phones the next two target OSes. The current SayWhat Android app is available in English, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian Korean, Japanese, traditional and simplified Chinese and Hebrew flavours.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:14:39 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "SayWhat App Helps You Find Out What A Caller Wants Before Picking Up The Phone"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:14:39 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/tNse-BRElB0/"], ["uuid", "c89aceb0-25db-0130-e0eb-34159e126286"]]

It uses cues like contact info including phone numbers, and potentially also iMessage email addresses to see who’s reaching out, and then selects an image to display partly at random, and partly based on weighted scores assigned to the frequency of any one image’s use, star ratings, and even information about location, date and time.</p>\n<p>It would be a small change, but a very neat one in practice. In theory, such a system would know to show you a picture of a friend at home in San Francisco if it detects that a call is coming from there. It could also show a snapshot of you and a significant other on vacation in New York City, if the phone detected that you were travelling there while receiving a phone call from home. The system can also display photos from approximately the same time of day as that of the origin call, which would actually be a handy visual shortcut to realize that someone on the other side of the world might be calling you very early in the morning or very early at night, regardless of what time it is locally.</p>\n<p>The system also could pick pictures based on which ones you’ve rated highly via a star system like the one Apple uses in Aperture and iPhoto, and even describes being able to serve small video clips in place of static images where appropriate. You can imagine it being applied not only to incoming phone calls, but also to SMS, iMessage and FaceTime communications.</p>\n<p>The patent was originally filed for in 2010, so Apple has had some time to work on the tech, and we haven’t seen any suggestion of its arrival in iOS as of yet. Patents are rarely good indicators of actual shipping product plans, but this is one that could put a unique, personal spin on a fairly standardized piece of the mobile phone experience, so here’s hoping we see some version of it make its way to Apple’s mobile devices.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:18:29 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Apple Patents Intelligent Caller ID That Turns Inbound Communication Into A Contextual Trip Down Memory Lane"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:18:29 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ct91P18nZ44/"], ["uuid", "51999da0-25dc-0130-e0ec-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Last week, Pinterest began curtailing the number of spammers and fake accounts on its system, in an effort to clear its platform off unwanted elements. At the time, the company noted that this latest big sweep would mainly affect those with larger follower counts, or those who had purchased fake followers. The majority (99 percent) of users would lose fewer than 10 followers, Pinterest said. Today, we have some figures on what those drops looked like, at least in terms of their affect on top Pinterest accounts.</p>\n<p>According to Lyle Dennis, co-creator of Pinterest user directory Top Pinterest Users, the top 10 most followed Pinterest users saw around a 20 percent decline in follower numbers immediately after the Pinterest purge. For example, the top Pinterest user (Joy Cho / Oh Joy!) had 12 million-plus followers before the clean out, and dropped to under 10 million afterwards. She has since gained again, and as of today sits at 10,124,648 followers.</p>\n<p>Dennis says he didn’t keep historical data on-hand for the larger Pinterest user base – he just happened to have noticed the changes thanks to a screencap of the Pinterest top 10 which was posted to a social media news blog just before the spam crackdown.</p>\n<p>Looking at the numbers again today, which have climbed again for some users since the purge, you can see that the event impacted the rankings, and even booted one user out of the top 10 entirely.

They were one of the early companies to experiment with midcore gaming on the Facebook platform.

Kabam is a leader in the industry and we look forward to being a part of their continued growth.”</p>\n<p>Kabam is already at work on another Hobbit title that’s currently in beta.

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper.

This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”\nAbout Blake Irving\nBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.\nIrving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo!

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Now it’s time to see if Facebook Gifts will be a nice supplement to the company’s revenue, or a core chunk of it. Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential.</p>\n<p>Facebook launched its social commerce product Gifts in September. It lets people choose a friend, often someone who’s birthday or wedding it is, and give them a real-life gift or gift card. At first it only allowed a few users to access the beta, but then let the service grow organically so anyone who received a Gift gained the ability to give them. It dropped another couple tens of millions of users into Gifts in late November, and now is finally publicly available so anyone in the US can give to other people stateside.</p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them. If it made $510 million a year, that would be $3 per year in additional average revenue per user in the US. That would nearly double the US ARPU from $3.4o to $6.40.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally — something it hasn’t announced any plans to do. But there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year. That’s a big hurdle for Gifts. Even if Facebook takes off in Facebook’s core markets like the UK, Germany, and Japan, it can’t scale to countries like Brazil and India.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been rapidly expanding the selection of what you can give. Today brings a whole new wine category plus new charitable organizations. A few weeks ago it added iTunes Gift Cards, and before that dozens of additional retailers to build on the 100+ it started with when Gifts launched.</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy. By combining web and mobile advertising, payments taxes, and commerce instead of relying on just one, it has the flexibility to tune up or down how aggressively it monetizes each channel and hedges its risk. If it can stack enough $500 million a year revenue sources and then keeps growing them, it could keep its stock price rising or at least grow into a more comfortable earnings multiple.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:18:37 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts From Beta To All US Users.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n April 4, 1974\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n NASDAQ:MSFT \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Microsoft, founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, is a veteran software company, best known for its Microsoft Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office suite of productivity software.\nStarting in 1980 Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM allowing Microsoft to sell its software package with the computers IBM manufactured. \nMicrosoft is widely used by professionals worldwide and largely dominates the American corporate market.\nAdditionally, the company has ventured into hardware with consumer products such as the Zune and...</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:18:40 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:18:40 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", "589cf8a0-25dc-0130-e0f3-34159e126286"]]

The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Blog to discuss it. Brand new versions of Yahoo! Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo!

Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:18:46 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

Picking up a name that’s easy to remember can be a boon for traffic and can add a little brand protection to a company’s arsenal. While big purchases often go unreported, top domain names have been known to fetch a high price, with “insure.com” and “sex.com” ranking as the highest on record at $16 million and $13 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Today, we can add another one to the list, as financial website Forexpros.com has purchased “Investing.com” for $2.45 million, making it the largest (known) purchase of a single domain name in 2012. Until today, dudu.com and personalloans.com ranked the highest, each selling for an estimated $1 million. According to Domaining.com, the sale puts Investing.com among the top 26 or so domain names purchased, right between coupons.com and tom.com. The largest known sale of 2011? Why that would be the purchase of social.com by Salesforce.com, of course.</p>\n<p>With the purchase, Forexpros will today launch a global financial portal under the Investing.com URL, where it plans to offer a free resource for novice and semi-professional traders and investors to find realtime quotes and charts, breaking news, financial tools, technical analysis and calendars.</p>\n<p>According to Forexpros founder and CEO Dror Efrat, the site will service all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, futures and Forex. As to why the company decided to shell out $2.45 million for the purchase? Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv. According to Efrat, Forexpros.com, which was founded in 2007, was averaging 3.6 million unique users per month before the company decided to go big and re-brand under Investing.com.</p>\n<p>“We are thrilled to launch investing.com today and believe that with our streaming real-time data, powerful analysis tools and great interface we can become a preeminent financial portal for novice and semi-professional investors and traders,” Efrat tells TechCrunch.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:18:48 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Top Domains: Forexpros Buys Investing.com For $2.45M, Launches One-Stop Financial Portal For Everyday Investors"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:18:48 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/8ejQD4-V0Yo/"], ["uuid", "5cf88f50-25dc-0130-e0f8-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Google may be the world’s largest mobile advertising company, but when it comes to devices that are driving the most advertising activity, it’s iOS and not Google’s Android that seems to set the heart racing. According to mobile browser and advertising company Opera Software, iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad continue to command the most usage among consumers.</p>\n<p>In the company’s latest State of Mobile Advertising survey, which analyses activity on Opera’s network of 10,000 mobile sites and some 40 billion monthly impressions globally, iOS devices collectively accounted for 44% of all ad impressions. Android devices, meanwhile, accounted for 26% of impressions.</p>\n<p>Opera notes two trends that have continued to keep Apple’s mobile platform in the lead when it comes to mobile ads.</p>\n<p>The first is the popularity of the iPhone 5. Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:18:50 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:18:50 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "5e0dd550-25dc-0130-e0f9-34159e126286"]]

A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on around 326,000 paying subscribers out of a total of 1 million Creative Cloud members, around 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

So what’s behind the losses and the resulting need for budget cuts?</p>\n<p>Despite a growing audience, it seems like advertisers are either less interested or less able to create campaigns on WebMD. That may in part be because of patents being up for a number of brand-name drugs put out by major pharmaceutical brands like Pfizer and others which happened in 2012, reports the Atlanta Business Chronicle, and it could also have to do with new, tighter regulations on how those companies are allowed to advertise their wares introduced this past year.</p>\n<p>WebMD CEO Cavan Redmond defended the decision in a statement in today’s press release, alluding only to greater competition in the space, but not offering any firm explanation of what exactly led to the losses and subsequent decision:</p>\n WebMD’s value proposition for users continues to be very strong. Becoming leaner and more nimble will enable the Company to extend our leadership in this highly dynamic and increasingly demanding marketplace. In addition, anticipated changes in U.S. healthcare will provide meaningful new opportunities to link the needs of patients, consumers and healthcare professionals to enable them to navigate their care.  We are moving swiftly to implement these operational changes and new market initiatives. \n<p>The company is “streamlining sales and delivery” as part of this initiative, and reallocating resources to areas with the greatest future growth potential. We’ve reached out to WebMD to find out more about the planned cuts, and any additional info about their plans they can provide, so we’ll update if and when we hear back.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n 1996\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>WebMD is the leading provider of health information and services to consumers and healthcare professionals.

By different, I mean that very rarely do you find a company that can follow its user’s pulse and passion as closely as only they can.</p>\n<p>Today, Twitter released its 2012 Year In Review, and while there might not be any surprises for those of you who remember all of this year’s big events, for others, it’s a walk down memory lane on a year that seems like a blur at this point.</p>\n<p>I have to say, this isn’t what I expected from the company. I’m used to long posts with links to information, leading to pages of more information, but this experience is visually appealing. The personal aspect of it makes it something that you can spend the next few weeks exploring and having fun with.

In 2012, everyone on Twitter brought us closer to moments and places that used to be far away or inaccessible: A Tweet from the bottom of the ocean. Tweets from Mars. An extraordinary view from space of Superstorm Sandy. A quiet backstage moment with a presidential candidate. All of these and millions of other such moments were ours to experience directly wherever we were, in the midst of work or play or travel. \n<p>My favorite reflection on 2012 is the most retweeted tweet, of course.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Back in September 2011, Farmigo took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt and launched its site for discovering and enrolling in Community Supported Agriculture programs (where you can sign up to receive boxes of fresh produce from local farms). Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital. The company has now raised a total of $10 million.</p>\n<p>Carrot.is/Harvesting from Carrot Creative on Vimeo.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n August 2009\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $2M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Farmigo is providing an alternative food system by enabling group-buying of fresh food directly from local farms &amp; producers, making it convenient and affordable to get local, seasonal food.\nA grassroots food movement has been driving the popularity of Farmerâ€™s Markets and CSA programs (Community Supported Agriculture).

It uses cues like contact info including phone numbers, and potentially also iMessage email addresses to see who’s reaching out, and then selects an image to display partly at random, and partly based on weighted scores assigned to the frequency of any one image’s use, star ratings, and even information about location, date and time.</p>\n<p>It would be a small change, but a very neat one in practice. In theory, such a system would know to show you a picture of a friend at home in San Francisco if it detects that a call is coming from there. It could also show a snapshot of you and a significant other on vacation in New York City, if the phone detected that you were travelling there while receiving a phone call from home. The system can also display photos from approximately the same time of day as that of the origin call, which would actually be a handy visual shortcut to realize that someone on the other side of the world might be calling you very early in the morning or very early at night, regardless of what time it is locally.</p>\n<p>The system also could pick pictures based on which ones you’ve rated highly via a star system like the one Apple uses in Aperture and iPhoto, and even describes being able to serve small video clips in place of static images where appropriate. You can imagine it being applied not only to incoming phone calls, but also to SMS, iMessage and FaceTime communications.</p>\n<p>The patent was originally filed for in 2010, so Apple has had some time to work on the tech, and we haven’t seen any suggestion of its arrival in iOS as of yet. Patents are rarely good indicators of actual shipping product plans, but this is one that could put a unique, personal spin on a fairly standardized piece of the mobile phone experience, so here’s hoping we see some version of it make its way to Apple’s mobile devices.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:21:16 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Apple Patents Intelligent Caller ID That Turns Inbound Communication Into A Contextual Trip Down Memory Lane"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:21:16 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ct91P18nZ44/"], ["uuid", "b4bfb1d0-25dc-0130-e100-34159e126286"]]

At the time, the company noted that this latest big sweep would mainly affect those with larger follower counts, or those who had purchased fake followers. The majority (99 percent) of users would lose fewer than 10 followers, Pinterest said. Today, we have some figures on what those drops looked like, at least in terms of their affect on top Pinterest accounts.</p>\n<p>According to Lyle Dennis, co-creator of Pinterest user directory Top Pinterest Users, the top 10 most followed Pinterest users saw around a 20 percent decline in follower numbers immediately after the Pinterest purge. For example, the top Pinterest user (Joy Cho / Oh Joy!) had 12 million-plus followers before the clean out, and dropped to under 10 million afterwards. She has since gained again, and as of today sits at 10,124,648 followers.</p>\n<p>Dennis says he didn’t keep historical data on-hand for the larger Pinterest user base – he just happened to have noticed the changes thanks to a screencap of the Pinterest top 10 which was posted to a social media news blog just before the spam crackdown.</p>\n<p>Looking at the numbers again today, which have climbed again for some users since the purge, you can see that the event impacted the rankings, and even booted one user out of the top 10 entirely.

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo!

Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential.</p>\n<p>Facebook launched its social commerce product Gifts in September. It lets people choose a friend, often someone who’s birthday or wedding it is, and give them a real-life gift or gift card. At first it only allowed a few users to access the beta, but then let the service grow organically so anyone who received a Gift gained the ability to give them. It dropped another couple tens of millions of users into Gifts in late November, and now is finally publicly available so anyone in the US can give to other people stateside.</p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them. If it made $510 million a year, that would be $3 per year in additional average revenue per user in the US. That would nearly double the US ARPU from $3.4o to $6.40.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally — something it hasn’t announced any plans to do. But there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year. That’s a big hurdle for Gifts. Even if Facebook takes off in Facebook’s core markets like the UK, Germany, and Japan, it can’t scale to countries like Brazil and India.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been rapidly expanding the selection of what you can give. Today brings a whole new wine category plus new charitable organizations. A few weeks ago it added iTunes Gift Cards, and before that dozens of additional retailers to build on the 100+ it started with when Gifts launched.</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy. By combining web and mobile advertising, payments taxes, and commerce instead of relying on just one, it has the flexibility to tune up or down how aggressively it monetizes each channel and hedges its risk. If it can stack enough $500 million a year revenue sources and then keeps growing them, it could keep its stock price rising or at least grow into a more comfortable earnings multiple.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:21:24 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts From Beta To All US Users.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>SeatGeek, which aggregates tickets from resale sites like StubHub, just launched its first iPhone app, one that allows users to browse interactive maps as they try to find the best deals.</p>\n<p>When SeatGeek raised funding back in August, the stated reason was to “build a really great mobile app.” Co-founder Russell D’Souza and Director of Communications Will Flaherty stopped by the TechCrunch office yesterday to show off the results of their work. The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap. (You can also filter searches so that they’re limited to sites that are designed for mobile checkout.)</p>\n<p>SeatGeek launched at the TechCrunch50 conference in 2009 and recently said that it has turned profitable.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n April 4, 1974\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n NASDAQ:MSFT \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Microsoft, founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, is a veteran software company, best known for its Microsoft Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office suite of productivity software.\nStarting in 1980 Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM allowing Microsoft to sell its software package with the computers IBM manufactured. \nMicrosoft is widely used by professionals worldwide and largely dominates the American corporate market.\nAdditionally, the company has ventured into hardware with consumer products such as the Zune and...</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:21:27 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:21:27 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", "bbc6fad0-25dc-0130-e107-34159e126286"]]

The goal for Speek is to instead make the experience super simple for people and provide a high quality call.</p>\n<p>Speek hopes to disrupt the market with a service that gives each customer a unique web address of their choosing. The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved. Data can also be shared.</p>\n<p>Bracken said they have had 50 to 100 people on the platform at any one time but it’s best suited for ten to 15 people.</p>\n<p>Speek hosts its service on the backbone of the Level3 fiber network.</p>\n<p>Speek will compete in the $3 billion audio conference market  and by extension the $20 to $25 billion unified communications market. Competitors are GoToMeeting, WebEx and really any service that gives out a 10-digit number and a pin.</p>\n<p>In beta since June, the service is intended for small businesses or the person in a large business who wants an alternatieve to traditional conference calls.</p>\n<p>I like this service. It lacks the collaboration features of web conferencing services but I expect that will come. The team is strong. Bracken is one of the co-founders of Evite.com, which sold to Ticketmaster in 2001. Danny Boice is the CTO. He is the  founder of Jaxara, which sold to Pantheon in 2006.</p>\n<p>Speek makes the conference call experience much more pleasant. I do a lot of conference calls.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo!

Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP.

Picking up a name that’s easy to remember can be a boon for traffic and can add a little brand protection to a company’s arsenal. While big purchases often go unreported, top domain names have been known to fetch a high price, with “insure.com” and “sex.com” ranking as the highest on record at $16 million and $13 million, respectively.</p>\n<p>Today, we can add another one to the list, as financial website Forexpros.com has purchased “Investing.com” for $2.45 million, making it the largest (known) purchase of a single domain name in 2012. Until today, dudu.com and personalloans.com ranked the highest, each selling for an estimated $1 million. According to Domaining.com, the sale puts Investing.com among the top 26 or so domain names purchased, right between coupons.com and tom.com. The largest known sale of 2011? Why that would be the purchase of social.com by Salesforce.com, of course.</p>\n<p>With the purchase, Forexpros will today launch a global financial portal under the Investing.com URL, where it plans to offer a free resource for novice and semi-professional traders and investors to find realtime quotes and charts, breaking news, financial tools, technical analysis and calendars.</p>\n<p>According to Forexpros founder and CEO Dror Efrat, the site will service all asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, futures and Forex. As to why the company decided to shell out $2.45 million for the purchase? Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv. According to Efrat, Forexpros.com, which was founded in 2007, was averaging 3.6 million unique users per month before the company decided to go big and re-brand under Investing.com.</p>\n<p>“We are thrilled to launch investing.com today and believe that with our streaming real-time data, powerful analysis tools and great interface we can become a preeminent financial portal for novice and semi-professional investors and traders,” Efrat tells TechCrunch.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:21:35 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Top Domains: Forexpros Buys Investing.com For $2.45M, Launches One-Stop Financial Portal For Everyday Investors"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:21:35 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/8ejQD4-V0Yo/"], ["uuid", "c0d95a90-25dc-0130-e10c-34159e126286"]]

Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:21:36 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:21:36 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "c1b507a0-25dc-0130-e10d-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Last December, Omada Health raised $800K in seed funding from a host of angel and venture investors, including NEA, Aberdare, Kapor Capital, TriplePoint Ventures and Esther Dyson — to name a few. A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on around 326,000 paying subscribers out of a total of 1 million Creative Cloud members, around 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn.

So what’s behind the losses and the resulting need for budget cuts?</p>\n<p>Despite a growing audience, it seems like advertisers are either less interested or less able to create campaigns on WebMD. That may in part be because of patents being up for a number of brand-name drugs put out by major pharmaceutical brands like Pfizer and others which happened in 2012, reports the Atlanta Business Chronicle, and it could also have to do with new, tighter regulations on how those companies are allowed to advertise their wares introduced this past year.</p>\n<p>WebMD CEO Cavan Redmond defended the decision in a statement in today’s press release, alluding only to greater competition in the space, but not offering any firm explanation of what exactly led to the losses and subsequent decision:</p>\n WebMD’s value proposition for users continues to be very strong.

I’m used to long posts with links to information, leading to pages of more information, but this experience is visually appealing.

In 2012, everyone on Twitter brought us closer to moments and places that used to be far away or inaccessible: A Tweet from the bottom of the ocean. Tweets from Mars. An extraordinary view from space of Superstorm Sandy. A quiet backstage moment with a presidential candidate. All of these and millions of other such moments were ours to experience directly wherever we were, in the midst of work or play or travel. \n<p>My favorite reflection on 2012 is the most retweeted tweet, of course.

Regardless, this is a pretty neat dashboard of all of your most interesting tweets:</p>\n<p>This is a pretty big week for Twitter, which just yesterday announced its latest update including photo filters, much to the surprise non-surprise of the community, especially after the whole Instagram deal.</p>\n<p>2012 was full of happiness, tragedy and everything in between.

Ultimately, however, founder and CEO Benzi Ronen told me the CSA model only works for “1 percent of the population,” while the company’s mission is to make “healthy, fresh food available to everyone.”</p>\n<p>That’s why Farmigo has launched a new program called local food communities. It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital. The company has now raised a total of $10 million.</p>\n<p>Carrot.is/Harvesting from Carrot Creative on Vimeo.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n August 2009\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $2M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Farmigo is providing an alternative food system by enabling group-buying of fresh food directly from local farms &amp; producers, making it convenient and affordable to get local, seasonal food.\nA grassroots food movement has been driving the popularity of Farmerâ€™s Markets and CSA programs (Community Supported Agriculture).

It uses cues like contact info including phone numbers, and potentially also iMessage email addresses to see who’s reaching out, and then selects an image to display partly at random, and partly based on weighted scores assigned to the frequency of any one image’s use, star ratings, and even information about location, date and time.</p>\n<p>It would be a small change, but a very neat one in practice. In theory, such a system would know to show you a picture of a friend at home in San Francisco if it detects that a call is coming from there. It could also show a snapshot of you and a significant other on vacation in New York City, if the phone detected that you were travelling there while receiving a phone call from home. The system can also display photos from approximately the same time of day as that of the origin call, which would actually be a handy visual shortcut to realize that someone on the other side of the world might be calling you very early in the morning or very early at night, regardless of what time it is locally.</p>\n<p>The system also could pick pictures based on which ones you’ve rated highly via a star system like the one Apple uses in Aperture and iPhoto, and even describes being able to serve small video clips in place of static images where appropriate. You can imagine it being applied not only to incoming phone calls, but also to SMS, iMessage and FaceTime communications.</p>\n<p>The patent was originally filed for in 2010, so Apple has had some time to work on the tech, and we haven’t seen any suggestion of its arrival in iOS as of yet. Patents are rarely good indicators of actual shipping product plans, but this is one that could put a unique, personal spin on a fairly standardized piece of the mobile phone experience, so here’s hoping we see some version of it make its way to Apple’s mobile devices.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:22:48 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Apple Patents Intelligent Caller ID That Turns Inbound Communication Into A Contextual Trip Down Memory Lane"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:22:48 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ct91P18nZ44/"], ["uuid", "ec081680-25dc-0130-e114-34159e126286"]]

At the time, the company noted that this latest big sweep would mainly affect those with larger follower counts, or those who had purchased fake followers. The majority (99 percent) of users would lose fewer than 10 followers, Pinterest said. Today, we have some figures on what those drops looked like, at least in terms of their affect on top Pinterest accounts.</p>\n<p>According to Lyle Dennis, co-creator of Pinterest user directory Top Pinterest Users, the top 10 most followed Pinterest users saw around a 20 percent decline in follower numbers immediately after the Pinterest purge. For example, the top Pinterest user (Joy Cho / Oh Joy!) had 12 million-plus followers before the clean out, and dropped to under 10 million afterwards. She has since gained again, and as of today sits at 10,124,648 followers.</p>\n<p>Dennis says he didn’t keep historical data on-hand for the larger Pinterest user base – he just happened to have noticed the changes thanks to a screencap of the Pinterest top 10 which was posted to a social media news blog just before the spam crackdown.</p>\n<p>Looking at the numbers again today, which have climbed again for some users since the purge, you can see that the event impacted the rankings, and even booted one user out of the top 10 entirely.

Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential.</p>\n<p>Facebook launched its social commerce product Gifts in September. It lets people choose a friend, often someone who’s birthday or wedding it is, and give them a real-life gift or gift card. At first it only allowed a few users to access the beta, but then let the service grow organically so anyone who received a Gift gained the ability to give them. It dropped another couple tens of millions of users into Gifts in late November, and now is finally publicly available so anyone in the US can give to other people stateside.</p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them. If it made $510 million a year, that would be $3 per year in additional average revenue per user in the US. That would nearly double the US ARPU from $3.4o to $6.40.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally — something it hasn’t announced any plans to do. But there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year. That’s a big hurdle for Gifts. Even if Facebook takes off in Facebook’s core markets like the UK, Germany, and Japan, it can’t scale to countries like Brazil and India.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been rapidly expanding the selection of what you can give. Today brings a whole new wine category plus new charitable organizations. A few weeks ago it added iTunes Gift Cards, and before that dozens of additional retailers to build on the 100+ it started with when Gifts launched.</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy. By combining web and mobile advertising, payments taxes, and commerce instead of relying on just one, it has the flexibility to tune up or down how aggressively it monetizes each channel and hedges its risk. If it can stack enough $500 million a year revenue sources and then keeps growing them, it could keep its stock price rising or at least grow into a more comfortable earnings multiple.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:22:58 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts From Beta To All US Users.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:23:03 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:23:03 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", "f49056c0-25dc-0130-e11b-34159e126286"]]

The goal for Speek is to instead make the experience super simple for people and provide a high quality call.</p>\n<p>Speek hopes to disrupt the market with a service that gives each customer a unique web address of their choosing. The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved. Data can also be shared.</p>\n<p>Bracken said they have had 50 to 100 people on the platform at any one time but it’s best suited for ten to 15 people.</p>\n<p>Speek hosts its service on the backbone of the Level3 fiber network.</p>\n<p>Speek will compete in the $3 billion audio conference market  and by extension the $20 to $25 billion unified communications market. Competitors are GoToMeeting, WebEx and really any service that gives out a 10-digit number and a pin.</p>\n<p>In beta since June, the service is intended for small businesses or the person in a large business who wants an alternatieve to traditional conference calls.</p>\n<p>I like this service. It lacks the collaboration features of web conferencing services but I expect that will come. The team is strong. Bracken is one of the co-founders of Evite.com, which sold to Ticketmaster in 2001.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:23:09 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics.

Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:23:12 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:23:12 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "fab58350-25dc-0130-e121-34159e126286"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Last December, Omada Health raised $800K in seed funding from a host of angel and venture investors, including NEA, Aberdare, Kapor Capital, TriplePoint Ventures and Esther Dyson — to name a few. A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on around 326,000 paying subscribers out of a total of 1 million Creative Cloud members, around 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn.

It has been piloting the idea with a few companies in San Francisco and New York, and as of today, organizations such as offices, schools, and community centers in those two cities (and more soon) can sign up. The goal, Ronen said, is to take the farmer’s market concept and make it much more accessible, so that it isn’t just open for a few hours on the weekend, and you don’t have to travel across town to reach it.</p>\n<p>Instead, each community has access to a group of local farms. To order food from those farms, customers just visit their dedicated Farmigo site, where they can buy things like (to quote the company’s description) “seasonal fruit, vegetables, eggs, meats, fish, bread, cheeses, and even wine and coffee.” Then the food is delivered to the community location within 48 hours of harvest. In other words, Ronen said, it’s a way that Farmigo can “bring the farmer’s market experience to you.”</p>\n<p>Ronen added that it’s important for these programs to go through specific organizations, rather than a more loosely defined “community” — that helps with things like logistics and security (your office may not want random people dropping by to pick up their food). He also compared the idea to the Kickstarter model, where businesses (in this case farms) get a certain amount of commitment from the community upfront so they know that serving a given customer base makes sense. Ronen said you probably need a 100-person office or an 80- to 100-family school in order to be big enough for a local food community to work — though there are exceptions. He also suggested that startups sharing an office could band together to create a community.</p>\n<p>Ronen is hoping that food evangelists will be the ones who bring the programs into their communities, and then they’ll spread from there.</p>\n<p>While I like the model, I asked if it’s really going to reach a mass audience. Ronen’s stated goal, after all, is 20 percent of the total population. He argued that by participating in Farmigo, people who are concerned with the industrial food system can “become part of the solution.” And if appealing to your altruism isn’t enough, he also said that Farmigo will become even more useful in the future, where it’s not just making shopping from local farms easier, but meal planning, too.</p>\n<p>The companies piloting the program include Etsy, Kiva, and Carrot Creative (a 40-person digital agency that’s seeing 75 percent adoption, thanks to company subsidies). You can see a food delivery at the Carrot Creative office in the video below.</p>\n<p>Farmigo is also announcing a new $8 million Series B round of funding led by Sherbrooke Capital and RSF Social Finance, with participation from past investor Benchmark Capital. The company has now raised a total of $10 million.</p>\n<p>Carrot.is/Harvesting from Carrot Creative on Vimeo.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n August 2009\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $2M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Farmigo is providing an alternative food system by enabling group-buying of fresh food directly from local farms &amp; producers, making it convenient and affordable to get local, seasonal food.\nA grassroots food movement has been driving the popularity of Farmerâ€™s Markets and CSA programs (Community Supported Agriculture). Purchasing produce directly from the grower is disrupting the traditional supermarket channel by providing fresher, healthier and tastier food.

It uses cues like contact info including phone numbers, and potentially also iMessage email addresses to see who’s reaching out, and then selects an image to display partly at random, and partly based on weighted scores assigned to the frequency of any one image’s use, star ratings, and even information about location, date and time.</p>\n<p>It would be a small change, but a very neat one in practice. In theory, such a system would know to show you a picture of a friend at home in San Francisco if it detects that a call is coming from there. It could also show a snapshot of you and a significant other on vacation in New York City, if the phone detected that you were travelling there while receiving a phone call from home. The system can also display photos from approximately the same time of day as that of the origin call, which would actually be a handy visual shortcut to realize that someone on the other side of the world might be calling you very early in the morning or very early at night, regardless of what time it is locally.</p>\n<p>The system also could pick pictures based on which ones you’ve rated highly via a star system like the one Apple uses in Aperture and iPhoto, and even describes being able to serve small video clips in place of static images where appropriate. You can imagine it being applied not only to incoming phone calls, but also to SMS, iMessage and FaceTime communications.</p>\n<p>The patent was originally filed for in 2010, so Apple has had some time to work on the tech, and we haven’t seen any suggestion of its arrival in iOS as of yet. Patents are rarely good indicators of actual shipping product plans, but this is one that could put a unique, personal spin on a fairly standardized piece of the mobile phone experience, so here’s hoping we see some version of it make its way to Apple’s mobile devices.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:26:34 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Apple Patents Intelligent Caller ID That Turns Inbound Communication Into A Contextual Trip Down Memory Lane"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:26:34 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ct91P18nZ44/"], ["uuid", "72e1a0d0-25dd-0130-e129-34159e126286"]]

At the time, the company noted that this latest big sweep would mainly affect those with larger follower counts, or those who had purchased fake followers. The majority (99 percent) of users would lose fewer than 10 followers, Pinterest said. Today, we have some figures on what those drops looked like, at least in terms of their affect on top Pinterest accounts.</p>\n<p>According to Lyle Dennis, co-creator of Pinterest user directory Top Pinterest Users, the top 10 most followed Pinterest users saw around a 20 percent decline in follower numbers immediately after the Pinterest purge. For example, the top Pinterest user (Joy Cho / Oh Joy!) had 12 million-plus followers before the clean out, and dropped to under 10 million afterwards. She has since gained again, and as of today sits at 10,124,648 followers.</p>\n<p>Dennis says he didn’t keep historical data on-hand for the larger Pinterest user base – he just happened to have noticed the changes thanks to a screencap of the Pinterest top 10 which was posted to a social media news blog just before the spam crackdown.</p>\n<p>Looking at the numbers again today, which have climbed again for some users since the purge, you can see that the event impacted the rankings, and even booted one user out of the top 10 entirely.

Today after two months of testing with tens of millions of people, Facebook is rolling out Gifts to all US users. It’s also launching a wine category, plus adding a Hurricane Sandy benefit and the Robin Hood foundation to the charities you can gift to. Let’s look at Gift’s earning potential.</p>\n<p>Facebook launched its social commerce product Gifts in September. It lets people choose a friend, often someone who’s birthday or wedding it is, and give them a real-life gift or gift card. At first it only allowed a few users to access the beta, but then let the service grow organically so anyone who received a Gift gained the ability to give them. It dropped another couple tens of millions of users into Gifts in late November, and now is finally publicly available so anyone in the US can give to other people stateside.</p>\n<p>Facebook has roughly 170 million users in the US, based on SocialBakers data and the company’s latest earnings call. It doesn’t reveal the revenue share between Facebook and its Gifts manufacturers, which is different depending on the Gift. But let’s say Facebook earns either 10%, 15%, or 20% per purchase. Some users will likely buy many Gifts, while many will likely buy none, so we’ll calculate assuming the average user buys one half, one, or two gifts per year. Gifts range in cost from $5 to over $50 so let’s assume a $15 average.</p>\n $15 x 170 million x 10% x .5 = $127.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 1 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 10% x 2 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x .5 = $191.25 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 1 = $382.5 million\n$15 x 170 million x 15% x 2 = $765 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x .5 = $255 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 1 = $510 million\n$15 x 170 million x 20% x 2 = $1.02 billion\n <p><img>So Facebook could be earning $127.5 million to $1.02 billion depending on how big a cut it gets, and how many Gifts people buy a year. That means it could account for up roughly 3% to 24% of its yearly revenue. Basically, Gifts will complement Facebook’s advertising and gaming revenue but won’t replace them. If it made $510 million a year, that would be $3 per year in additional average revenue per user in the US. That would nearly double the US ARPU from $3.4o to $6.40.</p>\n<p>This equation could change if Facebook can roll out Gifts internationally — something it hasn’t announced any plans to do. But there are plenty of shipping and localization problems with that. Not to mention the fact that most people around the world could not afford to buy even one $15 Gift per year. That’s a big hurdle for Gifts. Even if Facebook takes off in Facebook’s core markets like the UK, Germany, and Japan, it can’t scale to countries like Brazil and India.</p>\n<p>Facebook has been rapidly expanding the selection of what you can give. Today brings a whole new wine category plus new charitable organizations. A few weeks ago it added iTunes Gift Cards, and before that dozens of additional retailers to build on the 100+ it started with when Gifts launched.</p>\n<p>Piling up incremental revenue streams seems to be Facebook’s strategy. By combining web and mobile advertising, payments taxes, and commerce instead of relying on just one, it has the flexibility to tune up or down how aggressively it monetizes each channel and hedges its risk. If it can stack enough $500 million a year revenue sources and then keeps growing them, it could keep its stock price rising or at least grow into a more comfortable earnings multiple.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:26:42 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Facebook Rolls Out Gifts From Beta To All US Users.

The functionality should be pretty familiar to SeatGeek web users — you can search for tickets based on the performer, event, or venue. Then when you’ve found the event that you’re looking for, you can bring up a map showing where the different tickets would locate you, zoom in on any part of the map (usually surfacing more tickets as you do), then tap to buy.</p>\n<p>I was particularly impressed by how much information SeatGeek is able to pack onto the iPhone screen. Despite the limited visual real estate, the team seems to have found an elegant way to lay out a full stadium map with lots of dots representing tickets, and basic ticket info below. (The tickets are sorted based on SeatGeek’s deal scores.) Flaherty said SeatGeek worked hard to pare away a lot of the features that aren’t essential on the phone, focusing on the search and map experience. If the site is a Swiss Army knife, then the iPhone app “cut out all the tools,” leaving “a really sharp blade,” he said.</p>\n<p>D’Souza added that SeatGeek is the first smartphone ticketing app to include these kinds of interactive maps, rather than just static images of the venues. He argued that SeatGeek is “a technology company that happens to be in ticketing,” whereas its competitors “have the exact opposite mentality.” That also means we’ll see a number of rapid updates. (There’s also an Android app in development.) For example, D’Souza said he’s interested in the opportunities for integration with Apple’s PassBook.</p>\n<p>Mobile has been growing dramatically for SeatGeek, D’Souza added.  (The company already offered a mobile-optimized website, sans interactive maps.) It now makes up 25 percent of total traffic, and he said he wouldn’t be surprised if it accounted for the majority of SeatGeek’s traffic and revenue within 12 months.</p>\n<p>In fact, given the mobile growth both at SeatGeek and the ticketing industry as a whole, the real surprise may be that the startup has waited so long to launch the app. One holdup — SeatGeek’s actual ticket purchases occur on other websites, so it would be a bit annoying for users if they got a great mobile experience on SeatGeek, only to be a passed off onto a hard-to-navigate site to complete the deal. Now that many of the company’s partners have built mobile-optimized sites themselves, it made more sense for SeatGeek to make the leap.

The MS tablet, which debuted on October 26, has just 0.13 percent of overall web traffic share according to a study conducted between November 12 and 18. Google’s Nexus line of slates are easily outperforming it, but they’ve been on the market much longer, and it looks like Microsoft could overtake that subset of Android tablets, given time.</p>\n<p>The Nexus line, including the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, is making up just around 0.91 percent of all Chitika’s impressions. Judging by our own traffic figures to TechCrunch, the Nexus number matches up: Nexus tablets appear to make up only around 7 percent of the traffic of just the iPad alone, with other tablets helping to further dilute it overall share. Given that the Surface was only available to buyers for around a month at the time this study was taken, and that Microsoft is planning on debuting the Pro version of the tablet in January. Google is currently generating over seven times the traffic of its MS rival, but Chitika predicts they could one day be much closer in terms of overall web share.</p>\n<p>Of course, Google’s Nexus line hasn’t been standing still, either. It recently debuted the Nexus 10 on November 13, at the initial outset of this reporting period. That means its impact has yet to be truly felt. Also new in mid-November was the 3G-capable Nexus 7, and increased storage options for Nexus 7 Wi-Fi tablets. All of those could have a positive impact on Nexus tablet sales and eventual use, meaning that we might actually see the gap remain or continue to widen depending on how the holiday season turns out for both.</p>\n<p>Still, given that the figures here represent Google’s progress after seven months on market, and Microsoft’s after just one, it does seem likely we’ll see the latter gain some additional traction. Analysts are predicting Surface sales ranging from 500K to 1 million devices for the fourth quarter of 2012, and recently reports have suggested that expanded retail availability in January could help sales in the new year. One thing’s for sure: both Microsoft and Google need to see their user audience grow if they want to attract tablet-specific developers and apps away from market leaders like Apple.</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:26:45 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Microsoft Surface Off To A Slow Start In Tablet Web Traffic Share, But Could Catch Nexus Family In Time"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:26:45 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/1o6vN4BXviw/"], ["uuid", "796c87e0-25dd-0130-e130-34159e126286"]]

The goal for Speek is to instead make the experience super simple for people and provide a high quality call.</p>\n<p>Speek hopes to disrupt the market with a service that gives each customer a unique web address of their choosing. The web address connects the customer to a call that provides what they call a “conference table,” experience that allows participants to see who is on the call and who is talking. Identity is core to the Speek service. Customers that sign up are identified in the call by their name, e-mail address and associated social networks.</p>\n<p>There is now download required. The service comes integrated with Dropbox so people may share files by dragging them to the visual table.  A simple chat feature provides a visual cue for the other participants. It also has a mute feature.</p>\n<p>The caller receives a record of all their calls, which helps keep the data stored in one place. It includes the name, email addresses and the phone numbers of the callers. The chat transcript is also saved. Data can also be shared.</p>\n<p>Bracken said they have had 50 to 100 people on the platform at any one time but it’s best suited for ten to 15 people.</p>\n<p>Speek hosts its service on the backbone of the Level3 fiber network.</p>\n<p>Speek will compete in the $3 billion audio conference market  and by extension the $20 to $25 billion unified communications market. Competitors are GoToMeeting, WebEx and really any service that gives out a 10-digit number and a pin.</p>\n<p>In beta since June, the service is intended for small businesses or the person in a large business who wants an alternatieve to traditional conference calls.</p>\n<p>I like this service. It lacks the collaboration features of web conferencing services but I expect that will come. The team is strong. Bracken is one of the co-founders of Evite.com, which sold to Ticketmaster in 2001.

The database management software hasn’t been cooling its heels, however; it has consistently been improving upon its mobile native iOS apps since the iPhone version’s introduction in 2010, and that has resulted in impressive user growth: to date, over 500,000 iOS device owners have downloaded FileMaker Go.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, FileMaker is a tool that lets users create management systems for sales information and leads, medical records, inventory, project management and more. It’s a highly customizable database management system, that allows businesses to basically build their own solutions relatively quickly, starting either from templates or from their own data stored via Excel spreadsheets. With FileMaker Go, the company initially brought a means for its users to access all of that stored information on mobile devices; now, FileMaker VP of Marketing and Services Ryan Rosenberg says the vision has expanded, and is much more about showing businesses it’s possible not just to access pre-set productivity tools on the iPad and iPhone, but also to build their own, tailor-made for their own specific needs.</p>\n<p>“With FileMaker, since it’s a platform for creating solutions, we find commonly people have multiple solutions with FileMaker [unlike with single-purpose apps],” he explained in an interview. “And so people will deploy it for one thing, and then they’ll start layering other solutions on top of that, because we’re a tool for creating solutions, we’re not a solution in and of ourselves.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker essentially makes it possible for companies to go beyond using the iPad or iPhone as a way to simply access desktop content in a format that’s fit for mobile consumption. Instead, Rosenberg says that businesses are now just beginning to realize that they can create something totally unique on iPad that’s designed just for their business – a canvassing system for door-to-door surveys, for instance, or a sales tracking tool made for floor staff at a retail outlet, with fields created on a per-location or per-region basis.</p>\n<p>“We’re very excited because we think this is just the beginning”, he said. “We know from when we talk to our customers that they’re very excited about taking the use of these devices beyond simply personal productivity, to creating custom solutions for them. We think we’re at the beginning of the curve of creating these custom solutions for organizations, and we want to help them do that.”</p>\n<p>FileMaker has been around almost as long as Apple has, but just like Apple, the company isn’t content to stand still, and its mobile success is a reflection of that. I agree that businesses are still at a very early stage in terms of how they implement and use mobile devices, and FileMaker’s flexibility definitely puts it at the experimental forefront of what we might see next in terms of how businesses use iPads and iPhones in the field.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 2, 1998\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>FileMaker, Inc. develops award-winning database software.

Blog to discuss it. Brand new versions of Yahoo! Mail, one of its flagship products, is now available on all devices, and will be rolling out on the web soon.</p>\n<p>Coming from Google, Mayer knows the importance of having a solid Email product, a service that is probably the original social network and something that most people in the world use daily. This appears to be the first significant redesign for Yahoo Mail since 2011, which was introduced as a Beta in 2010.</p>\n<p>Basically, you wake up and check email before anything else these days. You also check it before you go to bed. Some of us check it during the night.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Mayer had to say about the redesign:</p>\n Email is the ultimate daily habit. It’s often the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. Why? Because it’s one of the simplest and most basic forms of communication. And since it’s such an important part of our daily lives, we’re making a few improvements to Yahoo! Mail.\nYou’ve told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to email. You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we’ve listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo! Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\nWe’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo! Mail with speed in mind — getting through your emails is faster than ever before. We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo! Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices. \n Good start? \n<p>As Yahoo! starts fresh, coming off as very partner-friendly, one must wonder what’s next for the company. It’s obvious that Mayer has come in and focused on the products that people use the most. Perhaps we’ll see an update to its homepage soon, its photo service, or even the dropping of the !. I kid. Kind of.</p>\n<p>Listening to your users, as Mayer tells us that she does, is the right way to get out of the gates with her new company. You really can never go wrong by taking a step back, looking at what’s going on in the marketplace, and then fixing your own products accordingly. Yahoo! had to keep up in the email race. It’s not one that’s over by any stretch, no matter how popular Gmail is. We all know people who prefer Yahoo! Mail, and regardless of their demographic, Mayer and company would like to keep them.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold out for this homepage redesign, though.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: Flickr]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Marissa Mayer is CEO of Yahoo. \nPreviously as a VP at Google, Marissa Mayer led the product management and engineering efforts of Google’s local, mobile, and contextual discovery products including Google Maps, Google Maps for Mobile, Local Search, Google Earth, Street View, Latitude and more.

Or more accurately, it’s today launching a product born out of Evertale’s best feature – shared photo albums.  The new app, called Wink, joins the now fairly crowded space involving social photo albums built on the fly.</p>\n<p>This new breed of apps are all themselves a variation on Color, the social photo album app maker, which spectacularly folded after raising $40 million in funding without gaining user traction. Today’s apps playing in this same space are more modestly funded, to say the least. Some of the top players include Flock, Tracks, Flayvr, and Moment.me, to name just of few of the “auto-magical” album makers out now.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these apps rely on things like smartphone sensors, algorithms and the user’s social graph to determine where you were when photos were taken. They then combine those with other photos your friends and family took at the same venue. Flock, from the makers of Bump, is probably the better known of the current group, offering grouped albums which can also be shared out to Facebook, or via SMS or email.</p>\n<p>Wink, however, has a different take. Instead of focusing on shared albums, the startup is thinking about shared, private albums. That is, the decision to share out to other networks isn’t included within Wink’s app by design.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, the way you interact with Wink is also different. While other album building apps allow you to upload photos you took in the past, matching them up with those from others’ albums, Wink faces a (familiar) cold start problem. Launch the app when there’s no one around, and you’re shown a list of recommended friends based on your social graph which you can invite to Wink. You can also tap on the “radar” feature on the bottom of the screen to see which friends are on Wink, but who are not nearby. Helpful?</p>\n<p>If no one is nearby or registered on Wink, then there’s no way to start taking photos. CEO Francsco Patarnello says that this will be changed in a later version. In the few months of testing, he says that users found it easier to understand the instant sharing experience when someone was around, so the team optimized for that.</p>\n<p>The company is targeting those ages 18 to 24, in high school and college, so the idea is that a group of friends would have to collectively agree to install Wink in order for it to gain traction. Hmm. Color had $41 million dollars and the same idea, pivoted away from that, then failed. Wink has an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Mangrove Capital– early backers of Skype, and shopping sites Brands4Friends and KupiVIP. It also clearly has the powers of positive thinking on its side.</p>\n<p>If you manage to convince your friends to use Wink, it then offers real-time private photo sharing, as well as import of other photos you may have taken with different camera apps. And it will also tag the photos of your nearby friends automatically. But at the end of the day, Wink seems a big bet that Color was too early and mismanaged, not that it was a bad idea to begin with.</p>\n<p>The company didn’t offer a current beta build of the app for testing beforehand, and much changed between the build in the App Store (a month old) and the one now launching, so we’re refraining from a hands-on review at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Wink is available for download here, but the updated version won’t arrive until later on today, so be aware.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n March 1, 2011\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Evertale is a stealth startup based in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:26:52 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "So It’s Like Color?

According to Domaining.com, the sale puts Investing.com among the top 26 or so domain names purchased, right between coupons.com and tom.com. The largest known sale of 2011?

Efrat and the company’s 70 employees want to turn Investing.com into a one-stop shop for financial traders and investors around the globe by providing streaming, realtime data and financial analytics. The user-friendly, memorable domain name is a small (and somewhat expensive) step in that direction.</p>\n<p>The founder says that Investing.com will be looking to differentiate itself from the biggest entities in the space (like Bloomberg and Reuters) by offering its content for free, including that which would generally fall under the “premium membership” umbrella on other sites and by appealing to novice and semi-professional traders and investors, rather than pros and large firms. The site will also be accessible in 18 languages, which the founder hopes will help it reach a larger, international audience.</p>\n<p>Investing.com has over 70 employees in offices located throughout the world, with its largest branches in Cyprus, Madrid and Tel Aviv.

Comparing its launch to that of Samsung’s Galaxy S III device earlier this year, Opera says the iPhone 5 has burst out of the starting gates at a much greater speed, and is now seeing more than double the activity of the Galaxy S III.</p>\n<p>The iPhone 5, which started to ship to people September 21, now accounts for 16.1% of all traffic on Opera’s mobile ad network. The prevalence of that newer device has also helped push iOS6, Apple’s latest version of the operating system, to account for 65% of all iOS ad requests.</p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy S III accounts for 8%, despite having launched four months earlier and projected to sell 30 million units by the end of this year. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the iPhone 5 is definitely selling better — we’ll have to wait for numbers from both companies to really make that comparison (and Samsung doesn’t give those out <img> ).</p>\n<p>What it does show is that iOS continues to be the more popular and sticky platform. This is also related to the second reason why iOS continues to shine on Opera’s network, and that’s the iPad. Opera in its report calls the iPad the “mad moneymaker” because of how much higher its e-cost-per-thousand impressions (eCPMs) are than for other wireless devices.</p>\n<p>This supports other research that we’ve seen that points to how engaged tablet users are, spending on average more time on their tablets than on other things consuming content, glued to the larger-screened, lean-back friendly devices. Some believe, like Opera, that this is having a knock-on effect on wider ad spend too.</p>\n<div>Opera doesn’t reveal in its report how well other iPhone or other Android models are performing — or other platforms, for that matter. But it’s worth pointing out that if iPhone 5 is at 16%, and iOS overall is at 44%, that means that older models of the iPhone (and probably the iPad) continue to be used quite a lot. How much? It’s not a direct point of comparison, but we could have a clue by looking at some stats that Marco Arment, the founder of the read-it-easier/later app Instapaper, tweeted out earlier today, on the subject of how his app is being used across Apple devices.</div>\n<div> iPhones:\n3GS: 4%\n4: 26%\n4S: 38%\n5: 32%\nTouches:\n2G: 6%\n3G: 13%\n4G: 66%\n5G: 14%\nOverall:\n50% iPads\n47% iPhones\n3% iPods Touch— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<div> Some quick Instapaper device stats:\niPads:\n1: 13%\n2: 38%\n3: 37%\n4: 4%\nMini: 8%\n57% Wi-Fi only\n43% 3G/4G— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) December 11, 2012 </div>\n<p>As you can see, the iPhone is performing well but in fact not as well — yet — as the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5, according to Instapaper’s founder Marco Arment, accounted for 32% of all Instapaper usage from iPhone devices, compared to 38% for the iPhone 4S and 26% for the iPhone 4. The fact that iPhone 5 is only at 16% of iPhone traffic on Opera’s network could mean that numbers for other versions of the iPhone will be even higher on Opera’s network.</p>\n<div>Opera has a strong focus on emerging/developing markets — it noted in fact that Russia and Ukraine accounted for the biggest growth on its network (perhaps one reason why they are launching their newest services, like Opera Music, in Russia first), with ad impressions rising by 95% this year.</div>\n<p>But in terms of dominant geographies, it says that the U.S. is still accounting for the “clear majority” of ad impressions at 65%, which is down from its peak of 73% earlier this year but still way ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>Opera — which, again, is pushing music and other media services of its own — also notes that media sites continue to be the most popular — calling out apps from Pandora, IMDb, Univsion, Demand Media and recipe/cooking app maker Big Oven as particularly strong performers. Given that music, video and lifestyle features tend to drive stronger engagement, this doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, though.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:26:55 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Opera: Strong iPhone 5 Adoption And Sticky iPad Usage Keeps iOS As Top Platform For Mobile Advertising"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:26:55 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uTswr0XGRDo/"], ["uuid", "7fc2a690-25dd-0130-e136-34159e126286"]]

A graduate of Rock Health’s first batch, the startup started out on a mission to take on diabetes (and prediabetes) by leveraging the latest research, design, behavioral science and digital technology.</p>\n<p>Today, after nearly a year in development and testing, Omada Health is launching Prevent, what the company is calling the “first-ever online diabetes prevention program for the general public.” Why? Because Diabetes is one of the most widespread diseases in the U.S., with the CDC estimating that 79 million American adults have prediabetes. That’s one in three adults, and the majority of them people aren’t aware of their condition, as they have blood glucose levels that aren’t irregular enough to be considered diabetes yet indicate an extremely high risk.</p>\n<p>According to Omada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the CDC has begun to allocate greater resources to what it considers to be a “national epidemic,” rolling out diabetes prevention programs in community centers across the country, for example. However, a recent National Institutes of Health-sponsored study called the “Diabetes Prevention Program” showed that a comprehensive behavioral weight loss program can help lower the development of diabetes without relying on medication.</p>\n<p>Prevent, the company’s flagship product, aims to complement the CDC’s on-the-ground prevention efforts by creating an “online version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for the general public,” Duffy says. The DPP was successful in showing that diabetes can be prevented, the CEO continued, but it was a behavior change program (rather than drug) and was thus challenging and expensive to roll out. So, the startup created its new program to make diabetes prevention available online and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>The 16-week program leverages an interactive, web-based curriculum, digital tracking tools, coaching and social support to encourage people at risk to create healthier behaviors. After joining the program, users are mailed a “welcome kit” that includes a mobile-connected wireless scale and pedometer, which track progress without the need for any setup. Users are matched with a coach and a group of peers that facilitate support and positive reinforcement and are then guided through 16 lessons based on the DPP’s clinical trial curriculum. </p>\n<p>Along the way, Omada mails additional packages to complement the curriculum and keep them on track. According to Duffy, the startup’s pilot study resulted in an average weight loss of 13.7 pounds after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>Along with making a scientifically-validated program available to the general public online, Omada is currently in the process of creating pilots and negotiating partnerships with third-party payers, like integrated health systems, private insurers and self-funded employers to cover the cost of the program for their employees and customers in the hopes of avoiding added health costs. </p>\n<p>This is especially relevant, as a recent UnitedHealth report showed that diabetes is one of the biggest contributors to healthcare costs in the U.S., with diabetes and prediabetes spending reaching $200 billion this year. (A number that is expected to grow to $500 billion by 2020.) The startup hopes that, in line with a complementary study by the Urban Institute, a comprehensive behavioral change program could help the U.S. save up to $191 billion over the next decade. </p>\n<p>“Evidence-based programs like Prevent can help equip doctors with the tools they need to combat the soaring diabetes epidemic in our country,” said Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Program, Dr. Anne Peters, as lifestyle interventions have traditionally been difficult to “prescribe” and primary care physicians tend not to recognize or treat prediabetes — instead only stepping in once it has progressed into full-blown diabetes.</p>\n<p>Duffy also added that Obamacare — President Obama’s Affordable Care Act — has helped bring attention to the skyrocketing rate of diabetes in the U.S. by laying the groundwork for a national prevention coalition. A bill recently introduced to the senate would allow DPP programs to be covered by Medicare, including Prevent, potentially bringing coverage to millions of Americans currently suffering from the disease.</p>\n<p>Prevent is available to anyone diagnosed with prediabetes or is at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The program includes a 2-week free trial, after which it is available for a membership fee of $120/month. After the 16 weeks, the price drops to $12/month.</p>\n<p>For more, find Omada Health at home here and more on how Prevent works here.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Omada Health (http://omadahealth.com) is a new Silicon Valley startup that has built an online diabetes prevention program based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical trial.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Adobe is hosting an event today to show off some new updates it’s making for its Creative Cloud offerings, but here’s an advance look: The service is getting a number of exclusive updates that seem clearly designed to paint it as the upgrade path of choice, vs. the boxed and digital on-time software licensing fees that creative pros have used to get access to products like Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator in the past. New to Creative Cloud is an offering aimed at collaboration called Teams, as well as a number of feature updates for Photoshop CS6 that will be made available only to Creative Cloud subscribers on monthly or annual plans.</p>\n<p>The new additions to Photoshop CS6 include the HiDPI and Retina Display support that the company announced and released to the public yesterday, which is also available to owners of existing licensed copies of the software. But all other new features are Creative Cloud exclusives  including Smart Object support for the Blur Gallery and Liquify tools, a new convert-to-CSS exporter for Photoshop files, letting you instantly generate usable code for text and object elements, with only relative positioning info needed to be added manually. Other additions include various time-saving tweaks, better 3D tools like live previews of shadows, and Conditional Actions based on user-defined rules for a more customizable, faster image processing workflow.</p>\n<p>All of the changes are nice, and in a product demo, the CSS export and new Smart Object support were especially impressive, but Adobe will likely take a lot of heat for keeping these changes limited to the Creative Cloud channel. The company is clearly invested in making this the path of choice for future Adobe creative suite users; it made a big deal of having signed on around 326,000 paying subscribers out of a total of 1 million Creative Cloud members, around 80 percent of whom are on annual plans, rather than the more costly, but less committed monthly options. Adobe argues that the reason they’ve seen such quick, high adoption is because of what Creative Suite means for subscribers and creative pros.</p>\n<p>“One of the reasons that Creative Cloud has been so popular is that one of the promises we made to customers is that if you went with Creative Cloud, you would always get a constant stream of innovation from Adobe,” Scott Morris, Senior Marketing Director of Creative Cloud and Creative Suite at Adobe explained on a press call. “You wouldn’t have to wait two years for major product releases; you would get access to updates and upgrades the moment they’re available.”</p>\n<p>Creative Cloud also now gets team support starting at $49.99 per month per seat for group members, allowing organizations or teams to sign up, and giving them access to everything from the individual version, but also adding virtual workgroup management, 100GB of cloud-based storage per user instead of 20GB, support services and an administrative panel for group software deployment and team management. Two other new additions are an Adobe Muse update that allows for creation of mobile-specific websites for individual devices, so the correct design will be served no matter where a user is viewing from, and Creative Cloud Connection, which is like Dropbox’s desktop integration but for saving to your Adobe-managed cloud storage.</p>\n<p>Digital Publishing Suite also now has a Single Edition, which can help users publish one-off content, like a brochure or catalog, and submit them directly to the Apple App Store for publication. It’s designed to give smaller companies access to the same kind of publishing power as major media entities, but without the added commitment requirements of ongoing content.</p>\n<p>Clearly, Adobe wants to make it very apparent that Creative Cloud members get preferential treatment with these updates. It’s a hard sell of the $49.99 monthly service (when on annual membership), and one that seems designed to steer folks away from buying individual copies outright. In many ways, it makes more sense for Adobe to operate this way (software-as-a-service model allows it to be more nimble and flexible, makes more sense for occasional use customers), but I can’t help but wonder how old-school media professionals will react to these changes.

The cuts include 250 positions, representing around 14 percent of WebMD’s total workforce, as well as operating expenditure cuts of $45 million. Layoffs are expected to mostly take place effective the end of 2012, but will also continue throughout the first quarter of 2012, the company said in a press release explaining the move.</p>\n<p>During its most recent quarterly results, the company saw revenue decline from $135 million during the year ago period to $117 million, with sponsorship and advertising income especially taking a downward turn.
