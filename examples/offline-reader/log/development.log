[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>I use my phone far more than I use a computer these days. If you’re not already, soon, you’ll be doing the same. Yes, a huge part of this is that it’s a device that is always with you. But recently, there’s something else I’ve noticed too.</p>\n<p>For a few services out there, I far prefer to use their apps instead of their websites. What’s interesting is that I don’t mean service that only exist as mobile apps or were built to be mobile first, I mean services that have been around for a while but have now nailed their mobile experience.</p>\n<p>These services started on the web, but have evolved to be much more interesting as mobile applications. Two easy examples: Tumblr and Facebook.</p>\n<p>Everyone knows that Facebook dropped the ball with regard to mobile for a long time. While the mobile usage numbers were growing, the product simply wasn’t very good. They went back to the drawing board with a “native” mindset and made what is actually a very good app. An app so good in fact, that it’s far better than their often slow, bloated website.</p>\n<p>I rarely use Facebook through facebook.com anymore. Instead, I chat with people through Messenger on mobile (both the stand-alone app and within the Facebook app), tag people and locations from the app, upload pictures from the app, and pretty much everything else. It’s a better and faster Facebook in just about every way.</p>\n<p>Tumblr is less straightforward because the site is still very good in that it’s performant and relatively non-cluttered. But with the most recent update to their iOS app, I find myself not wanting to visit tumblr.com while I’m at the computer and instead waiting to use the service until I’m on my phone (or iPad, which is just the iPhone version scaled-up since they still don’t have an iPad version).</p>\n<p>It’s something that’s almost hard to describe, but I now find myself with a sort of mental block from using these services on the web. I have this desire to close my laptop and get on my phone — even if I’m sitting at my desk — to use the services there. On mobile, they’re just a joy to use, better than the websites from which they sprung.</p>\n<p>Some of this is a native code vs. HTML debate. But both of these apps still utilize plenty of HTML. What makes them great is the performance optimization that the native code allows for mixed with re-worked user experiences for the mobile screen.</p>\n<p>Within Tumblr’s app, for example, you can hold down the reblog button for a few seconds and it will reblog any post for you without you having to click any other buttons. You can also pinch to open images full screen and move them around. And there are other hidden gems such as sliding the compose button upwards to reveal the camera for quick photo taking and posting. You just can’t do things like that on a computer.</p>\n<p>Nor would you want to. Captain Obvious: the mobile device is a different beast than a computer. Yes, they’re both technically computers in a sense, but form factors, available resources, and operating systems matter, amongst other things.</p>\n<p>For a long time, services were simply trying to port their websites over to mobile apps. The results mainly sucked. This opened a huge door to “mobile first” startups, and there’s still clearly all the opportunity in the world there because again, everyone is going to be using mobile devices more and computers less.</p>\n<p>This is and will continue to be the future for a long time to come. (Though here’s one good counter-argument.)</p>\n<p>But any service that already has a site would be wise to develop their mobile apps from scratch, perhaps even as more of a separate startup within the company. Think about what people love to do with your service at a fundamental level, but don’t put too much weight into how they’re doing those things on the web. In fact, don’t put any weight into it. Start anew. Get creative. Delight.</p>\n<p>This is a huge opportunity because it allows services that may already have some traction to leverage that into becoming a what I’ll cheekily rephrase as a “mobile burst” startup. That is, a service that may not have started on mobile, but one that is going to thrive on mobile.</p>\n<p>I bet there are a huge amount of such services out there right now — massive beasts laying mainly dormant under the warm, comforting blanket of the web. Unleash them.</p>\n<p>Disclosure: see my disclosures here. But for this post in particular, know that the venture capital firm where I’m a general partner, CrunchFund, owns shares of both Tumblr and Facebook. Tumblr, because I’m fucking addicted to it — especially on mobile now. Facebook, because investors were stupid enough to push it down to $19-a-share so I couldn’t in good conscience not buy it as a rational investor (and we own additional shares through an acquisition of one of our companies).</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:04 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Mobile Burst"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:04 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/XyoJP0OyKrQ/"], ["uuid", "adc7a360-25ef-0130-45ef-60c547060a7c"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>The New York Times this afternoon relaunched its Android application, with an improved, more responsive design, and added support for text-to-speech functionality, allowing readers to listen to the Times’ articles and blogs using Google’s built-in voice engine or another of their choice.</p>\n<p>Originally, the Times had experimented with a limited tablet application targeted towards 7-inch devices, which, according to Alex Hardiman, the Director of Mobile Products at the Times, helped the news outfit gain “helpful learnings,” towards this latest update.</p>\n<p>“Today, after the success of Google’s ICS [Ice Cream Sandwich] design guidelines, and with the proliferation of high quality Android tablets, we decided to invest in a truly responsive Android application that is visually optimized for all device screen sizes,” she says of the changes.</p>\n<p>The new release, version 3.0 as it’s called, is less about introducing new features, and more about this new, adaptive interface that now works on a range of tablets. Hardiman also tells us that The Times had been experimenting with a few of today’s “new” features like the text-to-speech functionality and voice-enabled commenting option over the past few months, and, after adding some polish to those items, have included those items in today’s update.</p>\n<p>In terms of the visual style of the application, the native design elements introduced in the September app redesign are still present. This includes the main action bar and article multi-select feature (used for sharing or building customized article “playlists”). The most noticeable visual change for users will actually be new the new, dynamic interface. On the phone, articles are laid out in one column and images are restricted to small and medium-sized crops, while on tablet devices, the layouts have multiple columns, larger images and scaled typography.</p>\n<p>Subscription pricing remains unchanged: a subscription to NYTimes.com + smartphone apps is $15; with tablet apps it’s $20; and all-digital access is $35; home subscribers have unlimited access to all the above). The Times says it doesn’t break out its digital subscriber numbers by device, but as of Q3 2012, it had 566,000 paid subscribers to its various digital subscription packages, e-readers, and replica editions of The New York Times and its global edition, The International Herald Tribune.</p>\n<p>News of the Android relaunch follows the release of an HTML5-optimized version of The Times in October – a move clearly meant to route around Apple’s Newsstand (and Apple’s cut).</p>\n<p>Catering To The Digital Crowd</p>\n<p>Optimizing for the tablet isn’t just a good move to enhance the user experience, however. A Pew Research study recently found that tablet owners tend to read for longer periods, and delve into more in-depth articles. Tablet owners spend an average of 51 minutes on news, the report said, while smartphone owners spend 54 minutes. But those who own both devices, read for 64 minutes on the tablet, and 54 minutes on their smartphones. 69 percent of tablet owners also read a full article when browsing through headlines, the report found. These are precisely the kinds of users The Times, and all news media organizations, for that matter, need to cater to.</p>\n<p>Another Pew study, released today, also speaks to the growing number of young readers who consume news digitally. The numbers revealed are both good and bad for paywalled news organizations like The NYT. Young adults rival or surpass older generations as news consumers, Pew says. 37 percent of smartphone owners ages 18 to 29 get news on their devices daily, while 40 percent of those 30 to 49 do. In the higher age brackets, 31 percent of those 50 to 64 read on mobile and 25 percent of the 60+ crowd do as well.</p>\n<p>Younger readers are also more likely to share news they read on mobile or tablet, and engage with ads. Those ages 18 to 29 were twice as likely to “at least sometimes” touch an ad on a tablet than those ages 30 to 49.</p>\n<p>Good so far, but…</p>\n<p>Pew also found that paying users tended to be the older crowd – those over 50 were more likely to have a print/digital combo: 20 percent did, while only 12 percent of those under 50 also do. And only 9 percent of the under 50 group said they had digital-only subscriptions.</p>\n<p>The updated NYT app is live now in Google Play here.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:10 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "The New York Times Relaunches On Android With Support For More Tablet Sizes, New Text-To-Speech Feature"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:10 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ftgdoki13lU/"], ["uuid", "b047e530-25ef-0130-45f1-60c547060a7c"]]

Today, Microsoft is giving the social sidebar a bit of a facelift by removing the dark gray background and making the overall design more streamlined and less cluttered.</p>\n<p>While Microsoft doesn’t emphasize this in its announcement, the new layout also seems to put a stronger emphasis on images by offering larger thumbnails for Facebook photos, for example.</p>\n<p>What the Bing team does note, though, is that users don’t have to hover over a friend’s avatar anymore to see additional content. Instead, all of the info is now available right in the sidebar. There is also now a “+ see all” icon that gives you access to even more social results. Microsoft also says the new design means there is less blank space on the page.</p>\n<p>One design element that seems to be gone in this redesign is the “Ask friends” box at the top of the search social sidebar. Bing replaced this with a Facebook “post” button that works about the same, but doesn’t include the call to action.</p>\n<p>These changes will roll out over the next few days, so it may take a while before you will see them when you search on Bing.</p>\n<p>The social sidebar, of course, is a key feature of Bing. Over time, though, Microsoft kept adding new services to it and it often felt rather cluttered. The new design removes a lot of this clutter, and the fact that it’s now flush with the rest of the results also makes the sidebar feel more like an integral part of the search experience.</p>\n<p>Just yesterday, it’s worth noting, Microsoft added some interesting new features to its Knowledge Graph-like snapshot feature, which occupies the middle column on the Bing search results pages. Unlike Google, though, which seems to be in the process of slowly de-emphasizing its social search efforts in favor of its Knowledge Graph results, Bing continues to mostly focus on its social search results.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Bing is a decision (search) engine from Microsoft officially announced on May 28, 2009.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Earlier today, after nearly a year in development, Omada Health launched to bring diabetes prevention online in an effort to help fight obesity in the U.S. NatureBox wants to do its part, too, and has announced that it has closed $2 million in seed funding to accelerate its business and help anyone and everyone discover healthier eating options.</p>\n<p>The investment is co-led by General Catalyst Partners and Redpoint Ventures and includes participation from a number of angel investors. Founded in 2011 and launched in January 2012, NatureBox has grown its subscriber base by 50 to 100 percent month-over-month and now has over 250K visits per month to its website, co-founder Gautam Gupta tells us.</p>\n<p>But what is this NatureBox all about? Simply put, NatureBox is looking to create a Trader Joe’s for the Web — or a Birchbox for organic foods, if you prefer. In other words, the company distributes its own brand of nutritionist-approved health foods, sending them to subscribers via box. The idea is to take the hassle (and guesswork) out of buying health snack foods, making those that are typically difficult to find in stores easily accessible online to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>The inspiration for NatureBox evolved from Gupta’s personal struggle with obesity throughout his childhood and the time spent early in his career as a VC at General Catalyst. Weighing in at over 210 pounds by age 12, Gupta lost 70 pounds through healthy eating and by the time he was 19 had landed an internship at the VC firm. And by the time he was a senior in college, he was fully immersed in the world of venture capital and had begun to focus on e-commerce investments.</p>\n<p>“NatureBox’s mission is personal to me,” the co-founder tells TechCrunch. After Gupta discovered that snack foods actually represented a $64 billion market and that there was tremendous market opportunity in providing a convenient way for consumers to get healthier foods that they couldn’t find at their local grocery store.</p>\n<p>According to Gupta, children and adults are snacking three times more than they did 30 years ago and consuming a third of their daily calories from snacks. Gupta believes that this is what caused his own struggles with obesity and thinks that it could have been prevented had he had access to healthier choices.</p>\n<p>He and co-founder Ken Chen (a friend from college and real estate investor) incubated the company with their own money and “began generating significant revenue at the outset,” Gupta says, before seeking out VC investment. With the new funding raised, NatureBox plans to expand its customer base and continue to grow its healthy foods brand. It will also use the new injection of capital to beef up its website and its staff and scale operations to meet growing demand.</p>\n<p>The company’s “private-labeled” snacks are hand picked each month and delivered in a recyclable snack box, and each includes 15 to 20 servings of four to six items, which have been “curated” by a nutritionist based on a seasonal health and wellness theme, Gupta tells us. In October, for example, the box was nicknamed “Antioxidant Trifecta” and included a combo of dark-skinned berries, raw nuts and dark chocolate. The snacks are sourced from local growers and indie food suppliers across the U.S. Every snack, the co-founder says, is free from high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, trans fats and artificial sweeteners, flavors and colors.</p>\n<p>Those interested can learn more at NatureBox.com. Oh, and another incentive to check it out? If the organic foods aren’t enough, for every box that the company delivers, like TOMS Shoes, it donates a meal to feed the hungry in the U.S. through partner organizations.</p>\n \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:16 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "NatureBox Lands $2M From General Catalyst, Redpoint To Go Big With Its “Birchbox For Healthy Foods”"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:16 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/p_W2MypREU8/"], ["uuid", "b468a780-25ef-0130-45f4-60c547060a7c"]]

The company wants to build better research and analytics tools for lawyers, in a way that dramatically changes the landscape of legal software, which Judicata founder Blake Masters describes as “notoriously inefficient and outdated” in a blog post announcing the news.</p>\n<p>Judicata’s mission is ambitious, which is likely why it hasn’t been undertaken in quite the same way before. Masters argues that previous attempts have only addressed symptoms and offshoots of the problems facing legal software and how it works for lawyers. Instead, the startup wants to take the mass of unstructured data represented by the body of case law that exists, and turn it into something structured, searchable and fully, properly indexed for targeted use. Judicata’s mission involves what it calls “mapping the legal genome,” which is a fancy way of saying it hopes to combine algorithmic, machine learning approaches to ingesting the mass of legal data and turning out something useful with careful human review to guarantee the accuracy of results.</p>\n<p>Masters uses Palantir as an analog, comparing that software’s ability to parse data to identify patterns that can help a human analyst make informed decisions to what its software can do for practicing lawyers. So it’s not a magic bullet, or an infallible virtual lawyer bot, but instead a refined tool that goes beyond clumsy approaches like full-text keyword search of archived PDF versions of paper decisions. Judicata will help lawyers by providing them with reasonable expectations about how, given the history of precedent available, decisions could or likely will go, and what they can do to sway the course of that probable ruling to make it more in line with their own desired outcome.</p>\n<p>The Judicata team, besides having some big-name early investors on board, also boasts impressively-skilled co-founders including Itai Gurari who helped build Google Scholar’s legal search. It’s still keeping product under wraps, but the fact that it has raised this funding without even a shipping product reflects the size and potential of the problem it aims to address.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n January 23, 2012\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Judicata is mapping the legal genome—i.e. using highly specialized case law parsing and algorithmically assisted human review to turn unstructured court opinions into structured data.

In contrast, ADP requires technical knowledge that calls for a level of training that is not uncommon with legacy solutions.</p>\n<p>Once signed up, the customer decides the payment schedule. Benefits can be added along with bonuses and reimbursements. Payroll taxes are automatically calculated and paid. Government payroll reports and documents are filled out and made ready to approve.</p>\n<p>ZenPayroll now supports full- and part-time employees. Contractors will be supported early next year.</p>\n<p>ZenPayroll raised its seed round in April and has taken the time since then to develop the technology, fill out the team — which includes engineers from Stanford and veterans of the payroll industry — and to start building a customer base. It has about 50 customers and processes several million dollars in payroll.</p>\n<p>In an email interview, Box’s Aaron Levie compared ZenPayroll to the powerhouse SaaS players that have generated billions in value over the past 10 years:</p>\n Here’s why I’m so excited about ZenPayroll…  First off, they’ve already assembled an amazing team: the caliber of people attacking this problem is unprecedented for the space. Second, it’s rare that you find a $10B+ category with this level of opportunity — it’s a market led by incumbents who have been around for decades that generally lack modern user experiences and business models. ZenPayroll is positioned to do for payroll what Salesforce did for CRM and Workday did for HCM. Furthermore, thanks to their delivery model and focus on simplicity, they’ll make payroll technology accessible to smaller businesses that still run off manual processes, expanding the market dramatically. \n<p>ZenPayroll comes at a time when the infrastructure of the modern back office is becoming an ecosystem of its own. Electronic signatures and digital fax services are replacing the manual processes of the back office. Tablets and smartphones give small business people flexibility without needing to have an office. The cloud makes it possible to rapidly update services with no applications to download and launch.</p>\n<p>Startups like ZenPayroll have tremendous potential, but the challenge will come with the fragmented small business market. Most small businesses have little knowledge or the time to think about new systems for conducting their business. Education is still critical. Reeves said that partnerships with accountants will be one strategy to reach the small business market. But that may be tough, as well. Accountants are small business people, too, with their  own old-fashioned ways.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:24 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "ZenPayroll Launches Cloud-Based Payroll Service With $6.1M In Seed Funding From CEOs At Yammer, Box, Yelp And Dropbox"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:24 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/KYlQiIThnQ8/"], ["uuid", "b9a60dd0-25ef-0130-45f8-60c547060a7c"]]

The updates, six months in development, are meant to increase focus on analytics and third-party integrations, encouraging users to post to Buffer across the web, instead of visiting the website itself.</p>\n<p>According to Buffer co-founder Leo Widrich, the biggest change today is that the company is no longer trying to make either the web or iPhone app a dashboard – meaning a destination for people to add content. Instead, he says, the company wants them to add content through Buffer’s integrations across the web.</p>\n<p>The reasoning behind today’s changes has to do with the fact that, following the release of the Buffer API in August, over 40 percent of Buffer’s updates were posted through the API and buttons, and this trend continues to grow today. The company wants to push that number closer to 100 percent if possible. “We heavily try to discourage people to add to Buffer through the web app or iPhone app,” says Widrich.</p>\n<p>With the new web app, Buffer’s redesign increases the focus on other features, like analytics, managing the updates queue, and discovering more apps where Buffer is integrated. Specifically, the web application now allows you to copy updates from one stream across to other social accounts (e.g. drag-and-drop updates from your Twitter account to your Facebook); it introduces a “shuffle” option to let Buffer’s algorithm randomize the order; it now lets you discover your top posts via the improved analytics section and copy them directly to another social account; and it lets you reorder your profiles more easily.</p>\n<p>The company also updated the iPhone app, which not only complements Buffer’s web application, but can also stand independently, never requiring use of the web at all. You can now connect all your social accounts from within the app, upload and Buffer images directly in the app, and see more detailed analytics (mentions, likes, comments – when before it only supported clicks and retweets). It also offers a media-rich preview of your queue, including images, videos, and link previews.</p>\n<p>Widrich says that today, 10,000 websites carry the Buffer button, and it’s now integrated in over 50 app integrations, including Reeder, Pocket, Feedly and more. Of the 410,000 Buffer users, around 10 percent (44,566) have installed the iPhone app, a number Widrich hopes will grow with today’s update. The Android app will be available in Q1 2013.</p>\n<p>Overall, Buffer users are consistently engaged, with 30 percent of the 410,000 active monthly, 20 percent weekly and 10 percent daily. The company also now has 7,000 paid subscribers and a revenue run rate of $900,000.</p>\n<p>Widrich is also excited to report that the Buffer team of seven have gotten their Visas and is now heading back to the U.S. next week. (You may remember that, in December last year, the team raised $400,000 in angel funding, but had to head back to Europe because of immigration laws.)</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n October 12, 2010\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $400k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Buffer is a smarter way to share pictures, links or videos on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.\nJust drop everything worth sharing in your Buffer and it will be posted for you well spaced out over the day, at a better time. \nIt works from anywhere, with lots of app integrations, browser extensions and shortcuts!</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:28 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "With Over 400,000 Users, Social Media Manager Buffer Gets A Refresh On Web & Mobile, Moves Away From Being A Destination Site"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:28 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/gSMkA-x04QE/"], ["uuid", "bbba34b0-25ef-0130-45fa-60c547060a7c"]]

After doing so, users receive extremely granular info and breaking news about those products, in the form of email alerts and product pages. (SMS alerts were available for a while, but were dropped due to low usage numbers).</p>\n<p>We first told you about the service back in April, which at the time only let you subscribe to breaking news about video games, electronics, cars and movies.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Oh, Yahoo! Mail. It’s one of those products that many of us used at one point, and it either stuck or didn’t. For a lot of users it did stick, as it is currently the No. 3 mail product on the web, behind Microsoft and Google’s products, of course.</p>\n<p>Today, the company announced a redesign across all platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone and web. Internally, the company called it the “Cuatro” release, for obvious reasons. I had a chance to speak with Adam Cahan, SVP, Emerging Products &amp; Tech, at Yahoo!, who is in a role that’s just a month old, set up by its CEO Marissa Mayer.</p>\n<p>We talked about today’s release, and how Yahoo! is entering a shift into iterative product design and maintenance, letting user feedback and usage patterns guide their way. This is nothing new as far as products go, but for Yahoo!, this might be a complete cultural shift.</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Can you tell us a bit about this launch?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: I think the most important piece is that we’re really focusing on the user behaviors and what users are here to do with email. The funny line we’re using internally is “we want to re-imagine email to be email.” When it comes to email, what you want is fast and easy, anywhere access. What we learned is that speed and simplicity are features, and that’s what users are trusting us with. We spent a lot of time not only on the details of the performance here, but also watching how it impacts everyone. We do a lot of bucket testing to see what happens.</p>\n<p>It takes a tiny bit of time for users to re-adapt, then we observe behavior. What we’ve found is that we’re getting more of their time.</p>\n<p>In terms of mobile, people expect that their products and providers are available anywhere they go. For email, it’s important for our users to have access to that.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Tell us about the cross-platform approach to your products, specifically something like Mail.</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: There’s a tremendous amount of nuance on every platform. Folks have been using webmail, so they come to expect certain things from Yahoo! and expect consistently. Each platform has its own subtlety. Nobody wants Mail on iOS and Android to act the same way. Our principles carry across though.</p>\n<p>For iPhone, infinite scroll is something that’s there. In the same way, for Android, we focus on screen density, seeing how many things you can display on a single screen. These are metaphors you see across devices. On Windows 8, we’re emphasizing things like Snap view and tiles, which are a new thing.</p>\n<p>The big emphasis is when we focus on these questions about users’ daily habits and what they’re doing on a regular basis, you start to see how small improvements on performance impact their daily life.</p>\n<p>The metric we know from the web release is that we’re saving 36 million minutes a day, which are tremendously meaningful minutes. That’s the scale of impact. We’re watching performance by the seconds and the minutes.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: How do you talk to your users?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: It depends on the nature of the product and design. In the case of something like Mail, you have the classic opportunity for bucket testing. This is where we can test behaviors. We want people to come back to email more, and get more done. It’s a bit more complex on mobile. We’re monitoring true performance there and the core technology: scroll view, battery, and things like that. Very product centric.</p>\n<p>We do get user feedback all of the time, we do read them and see what people are saying about the product. We have customer care that people reach out to, and we learn a lot through those channels. Something like speed and performance isn’t something that can really be articulated. If users are happy with your product, and your product is speedy and easy, they will change their behavior.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Iterative design. Tell us how launching things more often beats big yearly redesigns.</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: I was not directly involved in the 2010 Mail design. I’ve taken on my new role as taking on mobile. I will say this, you’re starting to see a lot of the guiding principles that we focus on coming to light in these products.</p>\n<p>We’re really actually focusing on the user and ensuring that we’re bringing out high-quality products with great design and performance. Also, we’re raising the bar on ourselves. We’re following a much more rapid cadence with iterating on our products now.</p>\n<p>There’s lots of other things going on.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Your role is new. Can you tell us more about it?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: My group is called “Emerging products and technology” – we brought together our mobile teams, any product that has a mobile component. Flickr and our connected TV platform. Bringing those three together as a focus is about these shifts in behaviors. People are engaging with all different forms of devices and we wanted teams to engage with our products on them.</p>\n<p>Personally, I came to Yahoo! a little over a year ago through the acquisition of IntoNow, a second screen application. I previously worked at Google as well, and did another startup called Auditude that Adobe acquired. Marissa created this role about a month ago.</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p>So here you have a golden opportunity for Yahoo! to grab marketshare in any number of verticals. Mail is clearly the focus right now, as it’s one of the most-used, fully-owned products at Yahoo’s disposal. Can it do the job right? Can it really bring an experience that keeps users happy, as well as potentially pull others away? Those are questions that need time to be answered.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Yahoo! Mail is starting to a look a little like Gmail, and that’s not a bad thing. Simple is better, especially when it comes to something like email, which nobody likes to do.</p>\n<p>What I can say is that for a lot of Yahoo’s products, there’s only one way to go, and that’s up. Make no mistake though, there is a long, long road ahead for Yahoo! Will it be paved in purple and gold? Stay tuned.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: GigaOm]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n January 1, 1994\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n December 4, 1996, Nasdaq:YHOO \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Yahoo was founded in 1994 by Stanford Ph.D. students David Filo and Jerry Yang.

It could also show a snapshot of you and a significant other on vacation in New York City, if the phone detected that you were travelling there while receiving a phone call from home. The system can also display photos from approximately the same time of day as that of the origin call, which would actually be a handy visual shortcut to realize that someone on the other side of the world might be calling you very early in the morning or very early at night, regardless of what time it is locally.</p>\n<p>The system also could pick pictures based on which ones you’ve rated highly via a star system like the one Apple uses in Aperture and iPhoto, and even describes being able to serve small video clips in place of static images where appropriate. You can imagine it being applied not only to incoming phone calls, but also to SMS, iMessage and FaceTime communications.</p>\n<p>The patent was originally filed for in 2010, so Apple has had some time to work on the tech, and we haven’t seen any suggestion of its arrival in iOS as of yet. Patents are rarely good indicators of actual shipping product plans, but this is one that could put a unique, personal spin on a fairly standardized piece of the mobile phone experience, so here’s hoping we see some version of it make its way to Apple’s mobile devices.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n April 1, 1976\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n NASDAQ:AAPL \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Started by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple has expanded from computers to consumer electronics over the last 30 years, officially changing their name from Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple, Inc. in January 2007.\nAmong the key offerings from Apple’s product line are: Pro line laptops (MacBook Pro) and desktops (Mac Pro), consumer line laptops (MacBook Air) and desktops (iMac), servers (Xserve), Apple TV, the Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server operating systems, the iPod, the...</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:36 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Apple Patents Intelligent Caller ID That Turns Inbound Communication Into A Contextual Trip Down Memory Lane"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:37:36 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ct91P18nZ44/"], ["uuid", "c10f96f0-25ef-0130-45ff-60c547060a7c"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Last week, Pinterest began curtailing the number of spammers and fake accounts on its system, in an effort to clear its platform off unwanted elements. At the time, the company noted that this latest big sweep would mainly affect those with larger follower counts, or those who had purchased fake followers. The majority (99 percent) of users would lose fewer than 10 followers, Pinterest said. Today, we have some figures on what those drops looked like, at least in terms of their affect on top Pinterest accounts.</p>\n<p>According to Lyle Dennis, co-creator of Pinterest user directory Top Pinterest Users, the top 10 most followed Pinterest users saw around a 20 percent decline in follower numbers immediately after the Pinterest purge. For example, the top Pinterest user (Joy Cho / Oh Joy!) had 12 million-plus followers before the clean out, and dropped to under 10 million afterwards. She has since gained again, and as of today sits at 10,124,648 followers.</p>\n<p>Dennis says he didn’t keep historical data on-hand for the larger Pinterest user base – he just happened to have noticed the changes thanks to a screencap of the Pinterest top 10 which was posted to a social media news blog just before the spam crackdown.</p>\n<p>Looking at the numbers again today, which have climbed again for some users since the purge, you can see that the event impacted the rankings, and even booted one user out of the top 10 entirely. Here’s how the numbers have changed for those users before and after the clean out:</p>\n<p>Before:</p>\n Joy Cho/ Oh Joy!: 12,733,689\nBekka Palmer: 8,465,927\nMaryann Rizzo: 8,073,270\nBonnie Tsang: 7,889,295\nJane Wang:  7,514,671\npejper:  6,826,436\nmolly pickering:  6,786,757\nJan of Poppytalk: 6,703,051\nHonestlyWTF: 5,483,892\nOlya Bastet: 5,162,212\n <p>After (as of today):</p>\n Joy Cho/ Oh Joy!: 10,124,648\nJane Wang:  6,876,464\nBekka Palmer: 6,785,853\nMaryann Rizzo: 6,742,899\nBonnie Tsang: 5,911,135\nmolly pickering: 5,435,822\nJan of Poppytalk:  5,410,144\npejper:  5,057,767\nHonestlyWTF:  4,392,324\nChristine Martinez: 4,255,261\n <p>Important, please note!  These “after” numbers are current as of today – at the time when Dennis reported the immediate effects to us, some of the after numbers were even lower, with declines falling into a 20-25 percent range, depending on the user, he says.</p>\n<p>Although the purge likely did only impact these larger user accounts to this extent, it’s a notable sweep, as the website itself only has around 40 million users globally, according to November numbers from comScore.</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, the Top Pinterest Users website, also built by Hugo Gameiro, continually checks the top users and boards on Pinterest to ensure its numbers are accurate.

Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.</p>\n<p>We don’t know the terms of the deal, but it follows a recent partnership between the two companies where Kabam took Lord of the Rings intellectual property and parlayed that into two different titles.

Kabam CEO Kevin Chou has already alluded to loose plans for an eventual IPO, but public markets have not been very hospitable to U.S. freemium gaming companies with Zynga’s valuation down to around $2 billion from a $14 billion figure before it filed its S-1.</p>\n<p>Kabam is one of the most heavily funded gaming companies that has titles in the top 50 grossing on the iOS and Android. They were one of the early companies to experiment with midcore gaming on the Facebook platform. But like many other developers, they pivoted toward iOS and Android when user acquisition became expensive and complicated on the Facebook platform.</p>\n<p>“We partnered with Kabam almost a year ago to deliver incredible games for The Hobbit trilogy, arguably one of the top intellectual properties in the world,” Tsujihara said in a statement. “As we worked with Kabam, it became clear that a closer, more strategic partnership made sense for us both. Kabam is a leader in the industry and we look forward to being a part of their continued growth.”</p>\n<p>Kabam is already at work on another Hobbit title that’s currently in beta.

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”\nAbout Blake Irving\nBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.\nIrving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo!

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>I use my phone far more than I use a computer these days. If you’re not already, soon, you’ll be doing the same. Yes, a huge part of this is that it’s a device that is always with you. But recently, there’s something else I’ve noticed too.</p>\n<p>For a few services out there, I far prefer to use their apps instead of their websites. What’s interesting is that I don’t mean service that only exist as mobile apps or were built to be mobile first, I mean services that have been around for a while but have now nailed their mobile experience.</p>\n<p>These services started on the web, but have evolved to be much more interesting as mobile applications. Two easy examples: Tumblr and Facebook.</p>\n<p>Everyone knows that Facebook dropped the ball with regard to mobile for a long time. While the mobile usage numbers were growing, the product simply wasn’t very good. They went back to the drawing board with a “native” mindset and made what is actually a very good app. An app so good in fact, that it’s far better than their often slow, bloated website.</p>\n<p>I rarely use Facebook through facebook.com anymore. Instead, I chat with people through Messenger on mobile (both the stand-alone app and within the Facebook app), tag people and locations from the app, upload pictures from the app, and pretty much everything else. It’s a better and faster Facebook in just about every way.</p>\n<p>Tumblr is less straightforward because the site is still very good in that it’s performant and relatively non-cluttered. But with the most recent update to their iOS app, I find myself not wanting to visit tumblr.com while I’m at the computer and instead waiting to use the service until I’m on my phone (or iPad, which is just the iPhone version scaled-up since they still don’t have an iPad version).</p>\n<p>It’s something that’s almost hard to describe, but I now find myself with a sort of mental block from using these services on the web. I have this desire to close my laptop and get on my phone — even if I’m sitting at my desk — to use the services there. On mobile, they’re just a joy to use, better than the websites from which they sprung.</p>\n<p>Some of this is a native code vs. HTML debate. But both of these apps still utilize plenty of HTML. What makes them great is the performance optimization that the native code allows for mixed with re-worked user experiences for the mobile screen.</p>\n<p>Within Tumblr’s app, for example, you can hold down the reblog button for a few seconds and it will reblog any post for you without you having to click any other buttons. You can also pinch to open images full screen and move them around. And there are other hidden gems such as sliding the compose button upwards to reveal the camera for quick photo taking and posting. You just can’t do things like that on a computer.</p>\n<p>Nor would you want to. Captain Obvious: the mobile device is a different beast than a computer. Yes, they’re both technically computers in a sense, but form factors, available resources, and operating systems matter, amongst other things.</p>\n<p>For a long time, services were simply trying to port their websites over to mobile apps. The results mainly sucked. This opened a huge door to “mobile first” startups, and there’s still clearly all the opportunity in the world there because again, everyone is going to be using mobile devices more and computers less.</p>\n<p>This is and will continue to be the future for a long time to come. (Though here’s one good counter-argument.)</p>\n<p>But any service that already has a site would be wise to develop their mobile apps from scratch, perhaps even as more of a separate startup within the company. Think about what people love to do with your service at a fundamental level, but don’t put too much weight into how they’re doing those things on the web. In fact, don’t put any weight into it. Start anew. Get creative. Delight.</p>\n<p>This is a huge opportunity because it allows services that may already have some traction to leverage that into becoming a what I’ll cheekily rephrase as a “mobile burst” startup. That is, a service that may not have started on mobile, but one that is going to thrive on mobile.</p>\n<p>I bet there are a huge amount of such services out there right now — massive beasts laying mainly dormant under the warm, comforting blanket of the web. Unleash them.</p>\n<p>Disclosure: see my disclosures here. But for this post in particular, know that the venture capital firm where I’m a general partner, CrunchFund, owns shares of both Tumblr and Facebook. Tumblr, because I’m fucking addicted to it — especially on mobile now. Facebook, because investors were stupid enough to push it down to $19-a-share so I couldn’t in good conscience not buy it as a rational investor (and we own additional shares through an acquisition of one of our companies).</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:28 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Mobile Burst"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:28 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/XyoJP0OyKrQ/"], ["uuid", "5dd9bcd0-25f3-0130-4603-60c547060a7c"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>The New York Times this afternoon relaunched its Android application, with an improved, more responsive design, and added support for text-to-speech functionality, allowing readers to listen to the Times’ articles and blogs using Google’s built-in voice engine or another of their choice.</p>\n<p>Originally, the Times had experimented with a limited tablet application targeted towards 7-inch devices, which, according to Alex Hardiman, the Director of Mobile Products at the Times, helped the news outfit gain “helpful learnings,” towards this latest update.</p>\n<p>“Today, after the success of Google’s ICS [Ice Cream Sandwich] design guidelines, and with the proliferation of high quality Android tablets, we decided to invest in a truly responsive Android application that is visually optimized for all device screen sizes,” she says of the changes.</p>\n<p>The new release, version 3.0 as it’s called, is less about introducing new features, and more about this new, adaptive interface that now works on a range of tablets. Hardiman also tells us that The Times had been experimenting with a few of today’s “new” features like the text-to-speech functionality and voice-enabled commenting option over the past few months, and, after adding some polish to those items, have included those items in today’s update.</p>\n<p>In terms of the visual style of the application, the native design elements introduced in the September app redesign are still present. This includes the main action bar and article multi-select feature (used for sharing or building customized article “playlists”). The most noticeable visual change for users will actually be new the new, dynamic interface. On the phone, articles are laid out in one column and images are restricted to small and medium-sized crops, while on tablet devices, the layouts have multiple columns, larger images and scaled typography.</p>\n<p>Subscription pricing remains unchanged: a subscription to NYTimes.com + smartphone apps is $15; with tablet apps it’s $20; and all-digital access is $35; home subscribers have unlimited access to all the above). The Times says it doesn’t break out its digital subscriber numbers by device, but as of Q3 2012, it had 566,000 paid subscribers to its various digital subscription packages, e-readers, and replica editions of The New York Times and its global edition, The International Herald Tribune.</p>\n<p>News of the Android relaunch follows the release of an HTML5-optimized version of The Times in October – a move clearly meant to route around Apple’s Newsstand (and Apple’s cut).</p>\n<p>Catering To The Digital Crowd</p>\n<p>Optimizing for the tablet isn’t just a good move to enhance the user experience, however. A Pew Research study recently found that tablet owners tend to read for longer periods, and delve into more in-depth articles. Tablet owners spend an average of 51 minutes on news, the report said, while smartphone owners spend 54 minutes. But those who own both devices, read for 64 minutes on the tablet, and 54 minutes on their smartphones. 69 percent of tablet owners also read a full article when browsing through headlines, the report found. These are precisely the kinds of users The Times, and all news media organizations, for that matter, need to cater to.</p>\n<p>Another Pew study, released today, also speaks to the growing number of young readers who consume news digitally. The numbers revealed are both good and bad for paywalled news organizations like The NYT. Young adults rival or surpass older generations as news consumers, Pew says. 37 percent of smartphone owners ages 18 to 29 get news on their devices daily, while 40 percent of those 30 to 49 do. In the higher age brackets, 31 percent of those 50 to 64 read on mobile and 25 percent of the 60+ crowd do as well.</p>\n<p>Younger readers are also more likely to share news they read on mobile or tablet, and engage with ads. Those ages 18 to 29 were twice as likely to “at least sometimes” touch an ad on a tablet than those ages 30 to 49.</p>\n<p>Good so far, but…</p>\n<p>Pew also found that paying users tended to be the older crowd – those over 50 were more likely to have a print/digital combo: 20 percent did, while only 12 percent of those under 50 also do. And only 9 percent of the under 50 group said they had digital-only subscriptions.</p>\n<p>The updated NYT app is live now in Google Play here.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:32 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "The New York Times Relaunches On Android With Support For More Tablet Sizes, New Text-To-Speech Feature"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:32 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ftgdoki13lU/"], ["uuid", "605d82b0-25f3-0130-4605-60c547060a7c"]]

Today, Microsoft is giving the social sidebar a bit of a facelift by removing the dark gray background and making the overall design more streamlined and less cluttered.</p>\n<p>While Microsoft doesn’t emphasize this in its announcement, the new layout also seems to put a stronger emphasis on images by offering larger thumbnails for Facebook photos, for example.</p>\n<p>What the Bing team does note, though, is that users don’t have to hover over a friend’s avatar anymore to see additional content. Instead, all of the info is now available right in the sidebar. There is also now a “+ see all” icon that gives you access to even more social results. Microsoft also says the new design means there is less blank space on the page.</p>\n<p>One design element that seems to be gone in this redesign is the “Ask friends” box at the top of the search social sidebar.

Founded in 2011 and launched in January 2012, NatureBox has grown its subscriber base by 50 to 100 percent month-over-month and now has over 250K visits per month to its website, co-founder Gautam Gupta tells us.</p>\n<p>But what is this NatureBox all about? Simply put, NatureBox is looking to create a Trader Joe’s for the Web — or a Birchbox for organic foods, if you prefer. In other words, the company distributes its own brand of nutritionist-approved health foods, sending them to subscribers via box. The idea is to take the hassle (and guesswork) out of buying health snack foods, making those that are typically difficult to find in stores easily accessible online to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>The inspiration for NatureBox evolved from Gupta’s personal struggle with obesity throughout his childhood and the time spent early in his career as a VC at General Catalyst. Weighing in at over 210 pounds by age 12, Gupta lost 70 pounds through healthy eating and by the time he was 19 had landed an internship at the VC firm. And by the time he was a senior in college, he was fully immersed in the world of venture capital and had begun to focus on e-commerce investments.</p>\n<p>“NatureBox’s mission is personal to me,” the co-founder tells TechCrunch. After Gupta discovered that snack foods actually represented a $64 billion market and that there was tremendous market opportunity in providing a convenient way for consumers to get healthier foods that they couldn’t find at their local grocery store.</p>\n<p>According to Gupta, children and adults are snacking three times more than they did 30 years ago and consuming a third of their daily calories from snacks. Gupta believes that this is what caused his own struggles with obesity and thinks that it could have been prevented had he had access to healthier choices.</p>\n<p>He and co-founder Ken Chen (a friend from college and real estate investor) incubated the company with their own money and “began generating significant revenue at the outset,” Gupta says, before seeking out VC investment. With the new funding raised, NatureBox plans to expand its customer base and continue to grow its healthy foods brand. It will also use the new injection of capital to beef up its website and its staff and scale operations to meet growing demand.</p>\n<p>The company’s “private-labeled” snacks are hand picked each month and delivered in a recyclable snack box, and each includes 15 to 20 servings of four to six items, which have been “curated” by a nutritionist based on a seasonal health and wellness theme, Gupta tells us. In October, for example, the box was nicknamed “Antioxidant Trifecta” and included a combo of dark-skinned berries, raw nuts and dark chocolate. The snacks are sourced from local growers and indie food suppliers across the U.S. Every snack, the co-founder says, is free from high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, trans fats and artificial sweeteners, flavors and colors.</p>\n<p>Those interested can learn more at NatureBox.com. Oh, and another incentive to check it out? If the organic foods aren’t enough, for every box that the company delivers, like TOMS Shoes, it donates a meal to feed the hungry in the U.S. through partner organizations.</p>\n \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:37 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "NatureBox Lands $2M From General Catalyst, Redpoint To Go Big With Its “Birchbox For Healthy Foods”"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:37 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/p_W2MypREU8/"], ["uuid", "637ef710-25f3-0130-4608-60c547060a7c"]]

The company wants to build better research and analytics tools for lawyers, in a way that dramatically changes the landscape of legal software, which Judicata founder Blake Masters describes as “notoriously inefficient and outdated” in a blog post announcing the news.</p>\n<p>Judicata’s mission is ambitious, which is likely why it hasn’t been undertaken in quite the same way before. Masters argues that previous attempts have only addressed symptoms and offshoots of the problems facing legal software and how it works for lawyers. Instead, the startup wants to take the mass of unstructured data represented by the body of case law that exists, and turn it into something structured, searchable and fully, properly indexed for targeted use. Judicata’s mission involves what it calls “mapping the legal genome,” which is a fancy way of saying it hopes to combine algorithmic, machine learning approaches to ingesting the mass of legal data and turning out something useful with careful human review to guarantee the accuracy of results.</p>\n<p>Masters uses Palantir as an analog, comparing that software’s ability to parse data to identify patterns that can help a human analyst make informed decisions to what its software can do for practicing lawyers. So it’s not a magic bullet, or an infallible virtual lawyer bot, but instead a refined tool that goes beyond clumsy approaches like full-text keyword search of archived PDF versions of paper decisions. Judicata will help lawyers by providing them with reasonable expectations about how, given the history of precedent available, decisions could or likely will go, and what they can do to sway the course of that probable ruling to make it more in line with their own desired outcome.</p>\n<p>The Judicata team, besides having some big-name early investors on board, also boasts impressively-skilled co-founders including Itai Gurari who helped build Google Scholar’s legal search. It’s still keeping product under wraps, but the fact that it has raised this funding without even a shipping product reflects the size and potential of the problem it aims to address.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n January 23, 2012\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Judicata is mapping the legal genome—i.e. using highly specialized case law parsing and algorithmically assisted human review to turn unstructured court opinions into structured data. We can leverage that data to build legal research and analytics tools that are an order of magnitude better than existing offerings.</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:39 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Judicata Raises $2M From Peter Thiel, Keith Rabois And Others To Give Lawyers Better Research And Analytics Tools"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:39 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/mEMrHZFTPG8/"], ["uuid", "648598f0-25f3-0130-4609-60c547060a7c"]]

The difference, says Co-Founder Nada Aldahleh, is the flexibility that the service gains by allowing for a more iterative project management.</p>\n<p>Aldahleh uses the term “infinite grids” to describe how Sandglaz can be broken down into adjustable milestones. A customer has the capability to break down task lists, add descriptions, and set notifications and due dates.

PercyVites, which launches publicly today, lets you send personalized video invitations to your child’s friends for their birthday.</p>\n<p>Currently, the web service supports the character Callilou, a popular PBS character. Users have the ability to customize the general template with their child’s name, the birthday activities, date and time. From there, it’s simple to just send along the video to parents’ email addresses, where they can watch the video invite along with their kids.</p>\n<p>The service also offers Thank You videos and photo compilation videos, all set in Callilou’s cute little world. Each video is about 30 seconds long, and plays a scene where Callilou interacts with the invitation itself in some way.</p>\n<p>In one, for example, Callilou is painting a model ship with his grandpa when he starts to paint something new, your child’s birthday invitation, complete with a picture of your little angel.</p>\n<p>But this is only the beginning. The company plans to add more and more characters to the service, yet that becomes difficult as many of these characters are heavily trademarked.</p>\n<p>Host parents can track the number of invitations opened and even record RSVPs through the PercyVites interface. Customization is a relatively painless process, and the creation and deployment of a PercyVite only takes about five minutes.

It is the largest seed round ever for a YC company, topping Funders Club, which raised $6 million in October.</p>\n<p>ZenPayroll executives did not disclose the lead investors. A spokesperson wrote in an email that there were several who have been actively involved with the company, so it didn’t make sense to call out a specific one. When the company does its next round of financing, it will be a traditional venture capital lead round.</p>\n<p>Here’s a partial list of investors:</p>\n Pejman Nozad\nAaron Levie, CEO and Co-Founder at Box\nData Collective\nDavid Sacks, CEO and Co-Founder, Yammer\nDrew Houston, CEO and Co-Founder, Dropbox\nGoogle Ventures\nJawed Karim, Co-Founder, YouTube\nJeremy Stoppelman, CEO and co-founder, Yelp\nKris Duggan, CEO and Co-Founder, Badgeville\nLarry Augustin, CEO, SugarCRM\nSalesforce.com\nSherpalo Ventures\nTien Tzuo, CEO and Co-Founder, Zuora\n <p>Reeves said ZenPayroll will offer a service that is easier to use than what is offered by ADP and Paychex, the two heavyweights in the payroll market that have a combined market value of $38 billion.</p>\n<p>The payroll market is prime for disruption. ADP and Paychex serve large companies but the smaller ones are still managing payroll like they did 50 years ago. Reeves says the service is designed for small businesses that increasingly do not have a corporate office and still, for the most part, manually do their own payroll. He says about 6 million businesses do their own payroll, with half managing it on paper and spreadsheets. The company will operate under a SaaS model. The cost is $25 per month and $4 per month for each employee. When a company grows to ten employees, the cost drops to $1 per employee per month.</p>\n<p>He said it takes about 10 minutes for a customer to sign up on ZenPayroll and gain access to the dashboard. In contrast, ADP requires technical knowledge that calls for a level of training that is not uncommon with legacy solutions.</p>\n<p>Once signed up, the customer decides the payment schedule. Benefits can be added along with bonuses and reimbursements. Payroll taxes are automatically calculated and paid. Government payroll reports and documents are filled out and made ready to approve.</p>\n<p>ZenPayroll now supports full- and part-time employees. Contractors will be supported early next year.</p>\n<p>ZenPayroll raised its seed round in April and has taken the time since then to develop the technology, fill out the team — which includes engineers from Stanford and veterans of the payroll industry — and to start building a customer base. It has about 50 customers and processes several million dollars in payroll.</p>\n<p>In an email interview, Box’s Aaron Levie compared ZenPayroll to the powerhouse SaaS players that have generated billions in value over the past 10 years:</p>\n Here’s why I’m so excited about ZenPayroll…  First off, they’ve already assembled an amazing team: the caliber of people attacking this problem is unprecedented for the space. Second, it’s rare that you find a $10B+ category with this level of opportunity — it’s a market led by incumbents who have been around for decades that generally lack modern user experiences and business models. ZenPayroll is positioned to do for payroll what Salesforce did for CRM and Workday did for HCM. Furthermore, thanks to their delivery model and focus on simplicity, they’ll make payroll technology accessible to smaller businesses that still run off manual processes, expanding the market dramatically. \n<p>ZenPayroll comes at a time when the infrastructure of the modern back office is becoming an ecosystem of its own. Electronic signatures and digital fax services are replacing the manual processes of the back office. Tablets and smartphones give small business people flexibility without needing to have an office. The cloud makes it possible to rapidly update services with no applications to download and launch.</p>\n<p>Startups like ZenPayroll have tremendous potential, but the challenge will come with the fragmented small business market. Most small businesses have little knowledge or the time to think about new systems for conducting their business. Education is still critical. Reeves said that partnerships with accountants will be one strategy to reach the small business market. But that may be tough, as well. Accountants are small business people, too, with their  own old-fashioned ways.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:44 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "ZenPayroll Launches Cloud-Based Payroll Service With $6.1M In Seed Funding From CEOs At Yammer, Box, Yelp And Dropbox"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:44 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/KYlQiIThnQ8/"], ["uuid", "67842600-25f3-0130-460c-60c547060a7c"]]

The updates, six months in development, are meant to increase focus on analytics and third-party integrations, encouraging users to post to Buffer across the web, instead of visiting the website itself.</p>\n<p>According to Buffer co-founder Leo Widrich, the biggest change today is that the company is no longer trying to make either the web or iPhone app a dashboard – meaning a destination for people to add content. Instead, he says, the company wants them to add content through Buffer’s integrations across the web.</p>\n<p>The reasoning behind today’s changes has to do with the fact that, following the release of the Buffer API in August, over 40 percent of Buffer’s updates were posted through the API and buttons, and this trend continues to grow today. The company wants to push that number closer to 100 percent if possible. “We heavily try to discourage people to add to Buffer through the web app or iPhone app,” says Widrich.</p>\n<p>With the new web app, Buffer’s redesign increases the focus on other features, like analytics, managing the updates queue, and discovering more apps where Buffer is integrated. Specifically, the web application now allows you to copy updates from one stream across to other social accounts (e.g. drag-and-drop updates from your Twitter account to your Facebook); it introduces a “shuffle” option to let Buffer’s algorithm randomize the order; it now lets you discover your top posts via the improved analytics section and copy them directly to another social account; and it lets you reorder your profiles more easily.</p>\n<p>The company also updated the iPhone app, which not only complements Buffer’s web application, but can also stand independently, never requiring use of the web at all. You can now connect all your social accounts from within the app, upload and Buffer images directly in the app, and see more detailed analytics (mentions, likes, comments – when before it only supported clicks and retweets). It also offers a media-rich preview of your queue, including images, videos, and link previews.</p>\n<p>Widrich says that today, 10,000 websites carry the Buffer button, and it’s now integrated in over 50 app integrations, including Reeder, Pocket, Feedly and more. Of the 410,000 Buffer users, around 10 percent (44,566) have installed the iPhone app, a number Widrich hopes will grow with today’s update.

After doing so, users receive extremely granular info and breaking news about those products, in the form of email alerts and product pages. (SMS alerts were available for a while, but were dropped due to low usage numbers).</p>\n<p>We first told you about the service back in April, which at the time only let you subscribe to breaking news about video games, electronics, cars and movies. They have now added television shows to their list of alert-able items.</p>\n<p>With television shows being distributed via so many digital channels these days — complete with unprecedented chatter by fans  — it’s a logical and timely choice to add to the LaunchGram offering. According to the team, television was the most requested addition to the service by users.</p>\n<p>I think LaunchGram, as an idea, is an interesting one and honestly they are tracking a decent number of items at their site. How are they tracking them? I spoke with Co-Founder and CEO Andy Sparks and he told me that they have a “healthy combination of user-generated tips coupled with their own internal curation.” Ultimately, LaunchGram verifies the authenticity of news about a certain game or movie or TV show.</p>\n<p>When it comes right down to it though — unlike some of their competition which employs armies of funders and workers by comparison —  the three LaunchGram founders are curating the content and are responsible for keeping it relevant.

Mail. It’s one of those products that many of us used at one point, and it either stuck or didn’t. For a lot of users it did stick, as it is currently the No. 3 mail product on the web, behind Microsoft and Google’s products, of course.</p>\n<p>Today, the company announced a redesign across all platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone and web. Internally, the company called it the “Cuatro” release, for obvious reasons. I had a chance to speak with Adam Cahan, SVP, Emerging Products &amp; Tech, at Yahoo!, who is in a role that’s just a month old, set up by its CEO Marissa Mayer.</p>\n<p>We talked about today’s release, and how Yahoo! is entering a shift into iterative product design and maintenance, letting user feedback and usage patterns guide their way. This is nothing new as far as products go, but for Yahoo!, this might be a complete cultural shift.</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Can you tell us a bit about this launch?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: I think the most important piece is that we’re really focusing on the user behaviors and what users are here to do with email. The funny line we’re using internally is “we want to re-imagine email to be email.” When it comes to email, what you want is fast and easy, anywhere access. What we learned is that speed and simplicity are features, and that’s what users are trusting us with. We spent a lot of time not only on the details of the performance here, but also watching how it impacts everyone. We do a lot of bucket testing to see what happens.</p>\n<p>It takes a tiny bit of time for users to re-adapt, then we observe behavior. What we’ve found is that we’re getting more of their time.</p>\n<p>In terms of mobile, people expect that their products and providers are available anywhere they go. For email, it’s important for our users to have access to that.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Tell us about the cross-platform approach to your products, specifically something like Mail.</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: There’s a tremendous amount of nuance on every platform. Folks have been using webmail, so they come to expect certain things from Yahoo! and expect consistently. Each platform has its own subtlety. Nobody wants Mail on iOS and Android to act the same way. Our principles carry across though.</p>\n<p>For iPhone, infinite scroll is something that’s there. In the same way, for Android, we focus on screen density, seeing how many things you can display on a single screen. These are metaphors you see across devices. On Windows 8, we’re emphasizing things like Snap view and tiles, which are a new thing.</p>\n<p>The big emphasis is when we focus on these questions about users’ daily habits and what they’re doing on a regular basis, you start to see how small improvements on performance impact their daily life.</p>\n<p>The metric we know from the web release is that we’re saving 36 million minutes a day, which are tremendously meaningful minutes. That’s the scale of impact. We’re watching performance by the seconds and the minutes.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: How do you talk to your users?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: It depends on the nature of the product and design. In the case of something like Mail, you have the classic opportunity for bucket testing. This is where we can test behaviors. We want people to come back to email more, and get more done. It’s a bit more complex on mobile. We’re monitoring true performance there and the core technology: scroll view, battery, and things like that. Very product centric.</p>\n<p>We do get user feedback all of the time, we do read them and see what people are saying about the product. We have customer care that people reach out to, and we learn a lot through those channels. Something like speed and performance isn’t something that can really be articulated. If users are happy with your product, and your product is speedy and easy, they will change their behavior.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Iterative design. Tell us how launching things more often beats big yearly redesigns.</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: I was not directly involved in the 2010 Mail design. I’ve taken on my new role as taking on mobile. I will say this, you’re starting to see a lot of the guiding principles that we focus on coming to light in these products.</p>\n<p>We’re really actually focusing on the user and ensuring that we’re bringing out high-quality products with great design and performance. Also, we’re raising the bar on ourselves. We’re following a much more rapid cadence with iterating on our products now.</p>\n<p>There’s lots of other things going on.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Your role is new. Can you tell us more about it?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: My group is called “Emerging products and technology” – we brought together our mobile teams, any product that has a mobile component. Flickr and our connected TV platform. Bringing those three together as a focus is about these shifts in behaviors. People are engaging with all different forms of devices and we wanted teams to engage with our products on them.</p>\n<p>Personally, I came to Yahoo! a little over a year ago through the acquisition of IntoNow, a second screen application. I previously worked at Google as well, and did another startup called Auditude that Adobe acquired. Marissa created this role about a month ago.</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p>So here you have a golden opportunity for Yahoo! to grab marketshare in any number of verticals. Mail is clearly the focus right now, as it’s one of the most-used, fully-owned products at Yahoo’s disposal. Can it do the job right? Can it really bring an experience that keeps users happy, as well as potentially pull others away? Those are questions that need time to be answered.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Yahoo! Mail is starting to a look a little like Gmail, and that’s not a bad thing. Simple is better, especially when it comes to something like email, which nobody likes to do.</p>\n<p>What I can say is that for a lot of Yahoo’s products, there’s only one way to go, and that’s up. Make no mistake though, there is a long, long road ahead for Yahoo! Will it be paved in purple and gold? Stay tuned.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: GigaOm]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n January 1, 1994\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n December 4, 1996, Nasdaq:YHOO \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Yahoo was founded in 1994 by Stanford Ph.D. students David Filo and Jerry Yang.

It uses cues like contact info including phone numbers, and potentially also iMessage email addresses to see who’s reaching out, and then selects an image to display partly at random, and partly based on weighted scores assigned to the frequency of any one image’s use, star ratings, and even information about location, date and time.</p>\n<p>It would be a small change, but a very neat one in practice. In theory, such a system would know to show you a picture of a friend at home in San Francisco if it detects that a call is coming from there. It could also show a snapshot of you and a significant other on vacation in New York City, if the phone detected that you were travelling there while receiving a phone call from home. The system can also display photos from approximately the same time of day as that of the origin call, which would actually be a handy visual shortcut to realize that someone on the other side of the world might be calling you very early in the morning or very early at night, regardless of what time it is locally.</p>\n<p>The system also could pick pictures based on which ones you’ve rated highly via a star system like the one Apple uses in Aperture and iPhoto, and even describes being able to serve small video clips in place of static images where appropriate. You can imagine it being applied not only to incoming phone calls, but also to SMS, iMessage and FaceTime communications.</p>\n<p>The patent was originally filed for in 2010, so Apple has had some time to work on the tech, and we haven’t seen any suggestion of its arrival in iOS as of yet. Patents are rarely good indicators of actual shipping product plans, but this is one that could put a unique, personal spin on a fairly standardized piece of the mobile phone experience, so here’s hoping we see some version of it make its way to Apple’s mobile devices.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n April 1, 1976\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n NASDAQ:AAPL \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Started by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple has expanded from computers to consumer electronics over the last 30 years, officially changing their name from Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple, Inc. in January 2007.\nAmong the key offerings from Apple’s product line are: Pro line laptops (MacBook Pro) and desktops (Mac Pro), consumer line laptops (MacBook Air) and desktops (iMac), servers (Xserve), Apple TV, the Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server operating systems, the iPod, the...</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:55 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Apple Patents Intelligent Caller ID That Turns Inbound Communication Into A Contextual Trip Down Memory Lane"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:03:55 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ct91P18nZ44/"], ["uuid", "6e71b720-25f3-0130-4613-60c547060a7c"]]

For example, the top Pinterest user (Joy Cho / Oh Joy!) had 12 million-plus followers before the clean out, and dropped to under 10 million afterwards. She has since gained again, and as of today sits at 10,124,648 followers.</p>\n<p>Dennis says he didn’t keep historical data on-hand for the larger Pinterest user base – he just happened to have noticed the changes thanks to a screencap of the Pinterest top 10 which was posted to a social media news blog just before the spam crackdown.</p>\n<p>Looking at the numbers again today, which have climbed again for some users since the purge, you can see that the event impacted the rankings, and even booted one user out of the top 10 entirely. Here’s how the numbers have changed for those users before and after the clean out:</p>\n<p>Before:</p>\n Joy Cho/ Oh Joy!: 12,733,689\nBekka Palmer: 8,465,927\nMaryann Rizzo: 8,073,270\nBonnie Tsang: 7,889,295\nJane Wang:  7,514,671\npejper:  6,826,436\nmolly pickering:  6,786,757\nJan of Poppytalk: 6,703,051\nHonestlyWTF: 5,483,892\nOlya Bastet: 5,162,212\n <p>After (as of today):</p>\n Joy Cho/ Oh Joy!: 10,124,648\nJane Wang:  6,876,464\nBekka Palmer: 6,785,853\nMaryann Rizzo: 6,742,899\nBonnie Tsang: 5,911,135\nmolly pickering: 5,435,822\nJan of Poppytalk:  5,410,144\npejper:  5,057,767\nHonestlyWTF:  4,392,324\nChristine Martinez: 4,255,261\n <p>Important, please note!  These “after” numbers are current as of today – at the time when Dennis reported the immediate effects to us, some of the after numbers were even lower, with declines falling into a 20-25 percent range, depending on the user, he says.</p>\n<p>Although the purge likely did only impact these larger user accounts to this extent, it’s a notable sweep, as the website itself only has around 40 million users globally, according to November numbers from comScore.</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, the Top Pinterest Users website, also built by Hugo Gameiro, continually checks the top users and boards on Pinterest to ensure its numbers are accurate. However, it does so without using an official API, as Pinterest has not yet released an API publicly at this time. The site also organizes users into various categories, like WeFellow did back in Twitter’s earlier days.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n 2008\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $138M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Pinterest is a social networking site with a visually-pleasing “virtual pinboard” interface.

Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.</p>\n<p>We don’t know the terms of the deal, but it follows a recent partnership between the two companies where Kabam took Lord of the Rings intellectual property and parlayed that into two different titles. The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle-Earth is basically a re-skinning of their original iOS title, but it’s also done quite well on the top-grossing charts and currently holds a #21 ranking in the U.S. iPhone charts. Kevin Tsujihara, who is president of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment takes a seat on Kabam’s board while MGM’s chairman and chief executive officer Gary Barber joins as a board observer.</p>\n<p>Whatever the amount of funding it is, it adds onto Kabam’s already hefty $125 million in venture capital from four separate rounds. Kabam CEO Kevin Chou has already alluded to loose plans for an eventual IPO, but public markets have not been very hospitable to U.S. freemium gaming companies with Zynga’s valuation down to around $2 billion from a $14 billion figure before it filed its S-1.</p>\n<p>Kabam is one of the most heavily funded gaming companies that has titles in the top 50 grossing on the iOS and Android. They were one of the early companies to experiment with midcore gaming on the Facebook platform. But like many other developers, they pivoted toward iOS and Android when user acquisition became expensive and complicated on the Facebook platform.</p>\n<p>“We partnered with Kabam almost a year ago to deliver incredible games for The Hobbit trilogy, arguably one of the top intellectual properties in the world,” Tsujihara said in a statement. “As we worked with Kabam, it became clear that a closer, more strategic partnership made sense for us both. Kabam is a leader in the industry and we look forward to being a part of their continued growth.”</p>\n<p>Kabam is already at work on another Hobbit title that’s currently in beta. The Hobbit: Armies of the Third Age is set for release early next year, following the premiere of the first of the three Hobbit films on December 14.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n November 1, 2006\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $125M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Kabam is an interactive entertainment company that develops massively multiplayer social games (MMSGs), including the popular and critically praised title Kingdoms of Camelot, voted IGN Reader’s Choice Best Facebook Game of 2010.

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”\nAbout Blake Irving\nBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.\nIrving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo! Incorporated, where he developed and rolled out the unified product vision and strategy – growing the company to nearly one billion active PC and mobile users.  Prior to Yahoo, he spent 15 years at Microsoft, serving in various senior roles, most recently as Corporate Vice President of the Windows Live Platform.  While at Microsoft, Irving was responsible for creating and leading a global development and operations organization of more than 4,000 employees in the creation and operation of Microsoft’s global online services, launching several new products, including MSN Messenger and growing Hotmail from 7 million to 290 million users.\nMr. Irving currently serves on the Board of GolfLogix, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based mobile Web company.  He has also served as a professor at Pepperdine University.  He is a graduate of San Diego State and received an MBA degree from Pepperdine University. \n<p>Photo Flickr</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:04:00 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "GoDaddy Doubles Down On Product With A New CEO: Ex-Yahoo Product Chief Blake Irving"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:04:00 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/4MbZu2aa8_s/"], ["uuid", "717028c0-25f3-0130-4616-60c547060a7c"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>I use my phone far more than I use a computer these days. If you’re not already, soon, you’ll be doing the same. Yes, a huge part of this is that it’s a device that is always with you. But recently, there’s something else I’ve noticed too.</p>\n<p>For a few services out there, I far prefer to use their apps instead of their websites. What’s interesting is that I don’t mean service that only exist as mobile apps or were built to be mobile first, I mean services that have been around for a while but have now nailed their mobile experience.</p>\n<p>These services started on the web, but have evolved to be much more interesting as mobile applications. Two easy examples: Tumblr and Facebook.</p>\n<p>Everyone knows that Facebook dropped the ball with regard to mobile for a long time. While the mobile usage numbers were growing, the product simply wasn’t very good. They went back to the drawing board with a “native” mindset and made what is actually a very good app. An app so good in fact, that it’s far better than their often slow, bloated website.</p>\n<p>I rarely use Facebook through facebook.com anymore. Instead, I chat with people through Messenger on mobile (both the stand-alone app and within the Facebook app), tag people and locations from the app, upload pictures from the app, and pretty much everything else. It’s a better and faster Facebook in just about every way.</p>\n<p>Tumblr is less straightforward because the site is still very good in that it’s performant and relatively non-cluttered. But with the most recent update to their iOS app, I find myself not wanting to visit tumblr.com while I’m at the computer and instead waiting to use the service until I’m on my phone (or iPad, which is just the iPhone version scaled-up since they still don’t have an iPad version).</p>\n<p>It’s something that’s almost hard to describe, but I now find myself with a sort of mental block from using these services on the web. I have this desire to close my laptop and get on my phone — even if I’m sitting at my desk — to use the services there. On mobile, they’re just a joy to use, better than the websites from which they sprung.</p>\n<p>Some of this is a native code vs. HTML debate. But both of these apps still utilize plenty of HTML. What makes them great is the performance optimization that the native code allows for mixed with re-worked user experiences for the mobile screen.</p>\n<p>Within Tumblr’s app, for example, you can hold down the reblog button for a few seconds and it will reblog any post for you without you having to click any other buttons. You can also pinch to open images full screen and move them around. And there are other hidden gems such as sliding the compose button upwards to reveal the camera for quick photo taking and posting. You just can’t do things like that on a computer.</p>\n<p>Nor would you want to. Captain Obvious: the mobile device is a different beast than a computer. Yes, they’re both technically computers in a sense, but form factors, available resources, and operating systems matter, amongst other things.</p>\n<p>For a long time, services were simply trying to port their websites over to mobile apps. The results mainly sucked. This opened a huge door to “mobile first” startups, and there’s still clearly all the opportunity in the world there because again, everyone is going to be using mobile devices more and computers less.</p>\n<p>This is and will continue to be the future for a long time to come. (Though here’s one good counter-argument.)</p>\n<p>But any service that already has a site would be wise to develop their mobile apps from scratch, perhaps even as more of a separate startup within the company. Think about what people love to do with your service at a fundamental level, but don’t put too much weight into how they’re doing those things on the web. In fact, don’t put any weight into it. Start anew. Get creative. Delight.</p>\n<p>This is a huge opportunity because it allows services that may already have some traction to leverage that into becoming a what I’ll cheekily rephrase as a “mobile burst” startup. That is, a service that may not have started on mobile, but one that is going to thrive on mobile.</p>\n<p>I bet there are a huge amount of such services out there right now — massive beasts laying mainly dormant under the warm, comforting blanket of the web. Unleash them.</p>\n<p>Disclosure: see my disclosures here. But for this post in particular, know that the venture capital firm where I’m a general partner, CrunchFund, owns shares of both Tumblr and Facebook. Tumblr, because I’m fucking addicted to it — especially on mobile now. Facebook, because investors were stupid enough to push it down to $19-a-share so I couldn’t in good conscience not buy it as a rational investor (and we own additional shares through an acquisition of one of our companies).</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:21 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Mobile Burst"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:21 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/XyoJP0OyKrQ/"], ["uuid", "c4e9dbc0-25f3-0130-4617-60c547060a7c"]]

Hardiman also tells us that The Times had been experimenting with a few of today’s “new” features like the text-to-speech functionality and voice-enabled commenting option over the past few months, and, after adding some polish to those items, have included those items in today’s update.</p>\n<p>In terms of the visual style of the application, the native design elements introduced in the September app redesign are still present. This includes the main action bar and article multi-select feature (used for sharing or building customized article “playlists”). The most noticeable visual change for users will actually be new the new, dynamic interface. On the phone, articles are laid out in one column and images are restricted to small and medium-sized crops, while on tablet devices, the layouts have multiple columns, larger images and scaled typography.</p>\n<p>Subscription pricing remains unchanged: a subscription to NYTimes.com + smartphone apps is $15; with tablet apps it’s $20; and all-digital access is $35; home subscribers have unlimited access to all the above). The Times says it doesn’t break out its digital subscriber numbers by device, but as of Q3 2012, it had 566,000 paid subscribers to its various digital subscription packages, e-readers, and replica editions of The New York Times and its global edition, The International Herald Tribune.</p>\n<p>News of the Android relaunch follows the release of an HTML5-optimized version of The Times in October – a move clearly meant to route around Apple’s Newsstand (and Apple’s cut).</p>\n<p>Catering To The Digital Crowd</p>\n<p>Optimizing for the tablet isn’t just a good move to enhance the user experience, however. A Pew Research study recently found that tablet owners tend to read for longer periods, and delve into more in-depth articles. Tablet owners spend an average of 51 minutes on news, the report said, while smartphone owners spend 54 minutes. But those who own both devices, read for 64 minutes on the tablet, and 54 minutes on their smartphones. 69 percent of tablet owners also read a full article when browsing through headlines, the report found. These are precisely the kinds of users The Times, and all news media organizations, for that matter, need to cater to.</p>\n<p>Another Pew study, released today, also speaks to the growing number of young readers who consume news digitally. The numbers revealed are both good and bad for paywalled news organizations like The NYT. Young adults rival or surpass older generations as news consumers, Pew says. 37 percent of smartphone owners ages 18 to 29 get news on their devices daily, while 40 percent of those 30 to 49 do. In the higher age brackets, 31 percent of those 50 to 64 read on mobile and 25 percent of the 60+ crowd do as well.</p>\n<p>Younger readers are also more likely to share news they read on mobile or tablet, and engage with ads. Those ages 18 to 29 were twice as likely to “at least sometimes” touch an ad on a tablet than those ages 30 to 49.</p>\n<p>Good so far, but…</p>\n<p>Pew also found that paying users tended to be the older crowd – those over 50 were more likely to have a print/digital combo: 20 percent did, while only 12 percent of those under 50 also do. And only 9 percent of the under 50 group said they had digital-only subscriptions.</p>\n<p>The updated NYT app is live now in Google Play here.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:25 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "The New York Times Relaunches On Android With Support For More Tablet Sizes, New Text-To-Speech Feature"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:25 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ftgdoki13lU/"], ["uuid", "c77ab830-25f3-0130-4619-60c547060a7c"]]

Today, Microsoft is giving the social sidebar a bit of a facelift by removing the dark gray background and making the overall design more streamlined and less cluttered.</p>\n<p>While Microsoft doesn’t emphasize this in its announcement, the new layout also seems to put a stronger emphasis on images by offering larger thumbnails for Facebook photos, for example.</p>\n<p>What the Bing team does note, though, is that users don’t have to hover over a friend’s avatar anymore to see additional content. Instead, all of the info is now available right in the sidebar. There is also now a “+ see all” icon that gives you access to even more social results. Microsoft also says the new design means there is less blank space on the page.</p>\n<p>One design element that seems to be gone in this redesign is the “Ask friends” box at the top of the search social sidebar. Bing replaced this with a Facebook “post” button that works about the same, but doesn’t include the call to action.</p>\n<p>These changes will roll out over the next few days, so it may take a while before you will see them when you search on Bing.</p>\n<p>The social sidebar, of course, is a key feature of Bing. Over time, though, Microsoft kept adding new services to it and it often felt rather cluttered. The new design removes a lot of this clutter, and the fact that it’s now flush with the rest of the results also makes the sidebar feel more like an integral part of the search experience.</p>\n<p>Just yesterday, it’s worth noting, Microsoft added some interesting new features to its Knowledge Graph-like snapshot feature, which occupies the middle column on the Bing search results pages.

Founded in 2011 and launched in January 2012, NatureBox has grown its subscriber base by 50 to 100 percent month-over-month and now has over 250K visits per month to its website, co-founder Gautam Gupta tells us.</p>\n<p>But what is this NatureBox all about? Simply put, NatureBox is looking to create a Trader Joe’s for the Web — or a Birchbox for organic foods, if you prefer. In other words, the company distributes its own brand of nutritionist-approved health foods, sending them to subscribers via box. The idea is to take the hassle (and guesswork) out of buying health snack foods, making those that are typically difficult to find in stores easily accessible online to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>The inspiration for NatureBox evolved from Gupta’s personal struggle with obesity throughout his childhood and the time spent early in his career as a VC at General Catalyst. Weighing in at over 210 pounds by age 12, Gupta lost 70 pounds through healthy eating and by the time he was 19 had landed an internship at the VC firm. And by the time he was a senior in college, he was fully immersed in the world of venture capital and had begun to focus on e-commerce investments.</p>\n<p>“NatureBox’s mission is personal to me,” the co-founder tells TechCrunch. After Gupta discovered that snack foods actually represented a $64 billion market and that there was tremendous market opportunity in providing a convenient way for consumers to get healthier foods that they couldn’t find at their local grocery store.</p>\n<p>According to Gupta, children and adults are snacking three times more than they did 30 years ago and consuming a third of their daily calories from snacks. Gupta believes that this is what caused his own struggles with obesity and thinks that it could have been prevented had he had access to healthier choices.</p>\n<p>He and co-founder Ken Chen (a friend from college and real estate investor) incubated the company with their own money and “began generating significant revenue at the outset,” Gupta says, before seeking out VC investment. With the new funding raised, NatureBox plans to expand its customer base and continue to grow its healthy foods brand. It will also use the new injection of capital to beef up its website and its staff and scale operations to meet growing demand.</p>\n<p>The company’s “private-labeled” snacks are hand picked each month and delivered in a recyclable snack box, and each includes 15 to 20 servings of four to six items, which have been “curated” by a nutritionist based on a seasonal health and wellness theme, Gupta tells us. In October, for example, the box was nicknamed “Antioxidant Trifecta” and included a combo of dark-skinned berries, raw nuts and dark chocolate. The snacks are sourced from local growers and indie food suppliers across the U.S. Every snack, the co-founder says, is free from high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, trans fats and artificial sweeteners, flavors and colors.</p>\n<p>Those interested can learn more at NatureBox.com. Oh, and another incentive to check it out? If the organic foods aren’t enough, for every box that the company delivers, like TOMS Shoes, it donates a meal to feed the hungry in the U.S. through partner organizations.</p>\n \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:30 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "NatureBox Lands $2M From General Catalyst, Redpoint To Go Big With Its “Birchbox For Healthy Foods”"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:30 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/p_W2MypREU8/"], ["uuid", "caa6a770-25f3-0130-461c-60c547060a7c"]]

The company wants to build better research and analytics tools for lawyers, in a way that dramatically changes the landscape of legal software, which Judicata founder Blake Masters describes as “notoriously inefficient and outdated” in a blog post announcing the news.</p>\n<p>Judicata’s mission is ambitious, which is likely why it hasn’t been undertaken in quite the same way before. Masters argues that previous attempts have only addressed symptoms and offshoots of the problems facing legal software and how it works for lawyers. Instead, the startup wants to take the mass of unstructured data represented by the body of case law that exists, and turn it into something structured, searchable and fully, properly indexed for targeted use. Judicata’s mission involves what it calls “mapping the legal genome,” which is a fancy way of saying it hopes to combine algorithmic, machine learning approaches to ingesting the mass of legal data and turning out something useful with careful human review to guarantee the accuracy of results.</p>\n<p>Masters uses Palantir as an analog, comparing that software’s ability to parse data to identify patterns that can help a human analyst make informed decisions to what its software can do for practicing lawyers. So it’s not a magic bullet, or an infallible virtual lawyer bot, but instead a refined tool that goes beyond clumsy approaches like full-text keyword search of archived PDF versions of paper decisions. Judicata will help lawyers by providing them with reasonable expectations about how, given the history of precedent available, decisions could or likely will go, and what they can do to sway the course of that probable ruling to make it more in line with their own desired outcome.</p>\n<p>The Judicata team, besides having some big-name early investors on board, also boasts impressively-skilled co-founders including Itai Gurari who helped build Google Scholar’s legal search. It’s still keeping product under wraps, but the fact that it has raised this funding without even a shipping product reflects the size and potential of the problem it aims to address.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n January 23, 2012\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Judicata is mapping the legal genome—i.e. using highly specialized case law parsing and algorithmically assisted human review to turn unstructured court opinions into structured data.

PercyVites, which launches publicly today, lets you send personalized video invitations to your child’s friends for their birthday.</p>\n<p>Currently, the web service supports the character Callilou, a popular PBS character. Users have the ability to customize the general template with their child’s name, the birthday activities, date and time. From there, it’s simple to just send along the video to parents’ email addresses, where they can watch the video invite along with their kids.</p>\n<p>The service also offers Thank You videos and photo compilation videos, all set in Callilou’s cute little world. Each video is about 30 seconds long, and plays a scene where Callilou interacts with the invitation itself in some way.</p>\n<p>In one, for example, Callilou is painting a model ship with his grandpa when he starts to paint something new, your child’s birthday invitation, complete with a picture of your little angel.</p>\n<p>But this is only the beginning. The company plans to add more and more characters to the service, yet that becomes difficult as many of these characters are heavily trademarked.</p>\n<p>Host parents can track the number of invitations opened and even record RSVPs through the PercyVites interface. Customization is a relatively painless process, and the creation and deployment of a PercyVite only takes about five minutes. It simplifies the whole process, and keeps things green to boot.</p>\n<p>PercyVites cost $.99 each.</p>\n <p>This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p>\n \n \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:36 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "PercyVites Are Personalized Video Invitations For Your Kid’s Birthday, Starring Their Favorite Cartoon Character"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:36 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/tizysYtmV-w/"], ["uuid", "ce00a1c0-25f3-0130-461f-60c547060a7c"]]

It is the largest seed round ever for a YC company, topping Funders Club, which raised $6 million in October.</p>\n<p>ZenPayroll executives did not disclose the lead investors. A spokesperson wrote in an email that there were several who have been actively involved with the company, so it didn’t make sense to call out a specific one. When the company does its next round of financing, it will be a traditional venture capital lead round.</p>\n<p>Here’s a partial list of investors:</p>\n Pejman Nozad\nAaron Levie, CEO and Co-Founder at Box\nData Collective\nDavid Sacks, CEO and Co-Founder, Yammer\nDrew Houston, CEO and Co-Founder, Dropbox\nGoogle Ventures\nJawed Karim, Co-Founder, YouTube\nJeremy Stoppelman, CEO and co-founder, Yelp\nKris Duggan, CEO and Co-Founder, Badgeville\nLarry Augustin, CEO, SugarCRM\nSalesforce.com\nSherpalo Ventures\nTien Tzuo, CEO and Co-Founder, Zuora\n <p>Reeves said ZenPayroll will offer a service that is easier to use than what is offered by ADP and Paychex, the two heavyweights in the payroll market that have a combined market value of $38 billion.</p>\n<p>The payroll market is prime for disruption. ADP and Paychex serve large companies but the smaller ones are still managing payroll like they did 50 years ago. Reeves says the service is designed for small businesses that increasingly do not have a corporate office and still, for the most part, manually do their own payroll. He says about 6 million businesses do their own payroll, with half managing it on paper and spreadsheets. The company will operate under a SaaS model. The cost is $25 per month and $4 per month for each employee. When a company grows to ten employees, the cost drops to $1 per employee per month.</p>\n<p>He said it takes about 10 minutes for a customer to sign up on ZenPayroll and gain access to the dashboard. In contrast, ADP requires technical knowledge that calls for a level of training that is not uncommon with legacy solutions.</p>\n<p>Once signed up, the customer decides the payment schedule. Benefits can be added along with bonuses and reimbursements. Payroll taxes are automatically calculated and paid. Government payroll reports and documents are filled out and made ready to approve.</p>\n<p>ZenPayroll now supports full- and part-time employees. Contractors will be supported early next year.</p>\n<p>ZenPayroll raised its seed round in April and has taken the time since then to develop the technology, fill out the team — which includes engineers from Stanford and veterans of the payroll industry — and to start building a customer base. It has about 50 customers and processes several million dollars in payroll.</p>\n<p>In an email interview, Box’s Aaron Levie compared ZenPayroll to the powerhouse SaaS players that have generated billions in value over the past 10 years:</p>\n Here’s why I’m so excited about ZenPayroll…  First off, they’ve already assembled an amazing team: the caliber of people attacking this problem is unprecedented for the space. Second, it’s rare that you find a $10B+ category with this level of opportunity — it’s a market led by incumbents who have been around for decades that generally lack modern user experiences and business models. ZenPayroll is positioned to do for payroll what Salesforce did for CRM and Workday did for HCM. Furthermore, thanks to their delivery model and focus on simplicity, they’ll make payroll technology accessible to smaller businesses that still run off manual processes, expanding the market dramatically. \n<p>ZenPayroll comes at a time when the infrastructure of the modern back office is becoming an ecosystem of its own. Electronic signatures and digital fax services are replacing the manual processes of the back office. Tablets and smartphones give small business people flexibility without needing to have an office. The cloud makes it possible to rapidly update services with no applications to download and launch.</p>\n<p>Startups like ZenPayroll have tremendous potential, but the challenge will come with the fragmented small business market. Most small businesses have little knowledge or the time to think about new systems for conducting their business. Education is still critical. Reeves said that partnerships with accountants will be one strategy to reach the small business market. But that may be tough, as well. Accountants are small business people, too, with their  own old-fashioned ways.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:38 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "ZenPayroll Launches Cloud-Based Payroll Service With $6.1M In Seed Funding From CEOs At Yammer, Box, Yelp And Dropbox"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:38 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/KYlQiIThnQ8/"], ["uuid", "cf051b00-25f3-0130-4620-60c547060a7c"]]

The updates, six months in development, are meant to increase focus on analytics and third-party integrations, encouraging users to post to Buffer across the web, instead of visiting the website itself.</p>\n<p>According to Buffer co-founder Leo Widrich, the biggest change today is that the company is no longer trying to make either the web or iPhone app a dashboard – meaning a destination for people to add content. Instead, he says, the company wants them to add content through Buffer’s integrations across the web.</p>\n<p>The reasoning behind today’s changes has to do with the fact that, following the release of the Buffer API in August, over 40 percent of Buffer’s updates were posted through the API and buttons, and this trend continues to grow today. The company wants to push that number closer to 100 percent if possible. “We heavily try to discourage people to add to Buffer through the web app or iPhone app,” says Widrich.</p>\n<p>With the new web app, Buffer’s redesign increases the focus on other features, like analytics, managing the updates queue, and discovering more apps where Buffer is integrated. Specifically, the web application now allows you to copy updates from one stream across to other social accounts (e.g. drag-and-drop updates from your Twitter account to your Facebook); it introduces a “shuffle” option to let Buffer’s algorithm randomize the order; it now lets you discover your top posts via the improved analytics section and copy them directly to another social account; and it lets you reorder your profiles more easily.</p>\n<p>The company also updated the iPhone app, which not only complements Buffer’s web application, but can also stand independently, never requiring use of the web at all. You can now connect all your social accounts from within the app, upload and Buffer images directly in the app, and see more detailed analytics (mentions, likes, comments – when before it only supported clicks and retweets). It also offers a media-rich preview of your queue, including images, videos, and link previews.</p>\n<p>Widrich says that today, 10,000 websites carry the Buffer button, and it’s now integrated in over 50 app integrations, including Reeder, Pocket, Feedly and more. Of the 410,000 Buffer users, around 10 percent (44,566) have installed the iPhone app, a number Widrich hopes will grow with today’s update. The Android app will be available in Q1 2013.</p>\n<p>Overall, Buffer users are consistently engaged, with 30 percent of the 410,000 active monthly, 20 percent weekly and 10 percent daily. The company also now has 7,000 paid subscribers and a revenue run rate of $900,000.</p>\n<p>Widrich is also excited to report that the Buffer team of seven have gotten their Visas and is now heading back to the U.S. next week. (You may remember that, in December last year, the team raised $400,000 in angel funding, but had to head back to Europe because of immigration laws.)</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n October 12, 2010\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $400k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Buffer is a smarter way to share pictures, links or videos on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.\nJust drop everything worth sharing in your Buffer and it will be posted for you well spaced out over the day, at a better time. \nIt works from anywhere, with lots of app integrations, browser extensions and shortcuts!</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:41 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "With Over 400,000 Users, Social Media Manager Buffer Gets A Refresh On Web & Mobile, Moves Away From Being A Destination Site"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:41 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/gSMkA-x04QE/"], ["uuid", "d12207f0-25f3-0130-4622-60c547060a7c"]]

After doing so, users receive extremely granular info and breaking news about those products, in the form of email alerts and product pages.

Mail. It’s one of those products that many of us used at one point, and it either stuck or didn’t. For a lot of users it did stick, as it is currently the No. 3 mail product on the web, behind Microsoft and Google’s products, of course.</p>\n<p>Today, the company announced a redesign across all platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone and web. Internally, the company called it the “Cuatro” release, for obvious reasons. I had a chance to speak with Adam Cahan, SVP, Emerging Products &amp; Tech, at Yahoo!, who is in a role that’s just a month old, set up by its CEO Marissa Mayer.</p>\n<p>We talked about today’s release, and how Yahoo! is entering a shift into iterative product design and maintenance, letting user feedback and usage patterns guide their way. This is nothing new as far as products go, but for Yahoo!, this might be a complete cultural shift.</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Can you tell us a bit about this launch?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: I think the most important piece is that we’re really focusing on the user behaviors and what users are here to do with email. The funny line we’re using internally is “we want to re-imagine email to be email.” When it comes to email, what you want is fast and easy, anywhere access. What we learned is that speed and simplicity are features, and that’s what users are trusting us with. We spent a lot of time not only on the details of the performance here, but also watching how it impacts everyone. We do a lot of bucket testing to see what happens.</p>\n<p>It takes a tiny bit of time for users to re-adapt, then we observe behavior. What we’ve found is that we’re getting more of their time.</p>\n<p>In terms of mobile, people expect that their products and providers are available anywhere they go. For email, it’s important for our users to have access to that.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Tell us about the cross-platform approach to your products, specifically something like Mail.</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: There’s a tremendous amount of nuance on every platform. Folks have been using webmail, so they come to expect certain things from Yahoo! and expect consistently. Each platform has its own subtlety. Nobody wants Mail on iOS and Android to act the same way. Our principles carry across though.</p>\n<p>For iPhone, infinite scroll is something that’s there. In the same way, for Android, we focus on screen density, seeing how many things you can display on a single screen. These are metaphors you see across devices. On Windows 8, we’re emphasizing things like Snap view and tiles, which are a new thing.</p>\n<p>The big emphasis is when we focus on these questions about users’ daily habits and what they’re doing on a regular basis, you start to see how small improvements on performance impact their daily life.</p>\n<p>The metric we know from the web release is that we’re saving 36 million minutes a day, which are tremendously meaningful minutes. That’s the scale of impact. We’re watching performance by the seconds and the minutes.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: How do you talk to your users?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: It depends on the nature of the product and design. In the case of something like Mail, you have the classic opportunity for bucket testing. This is where we can test behaviors. We want people to come back to email more, and get more done. It’s a bit more complex on mobile. We’re monitoring true performance there and the core technology: scroll view, battery, and things like that. Very product centric.</p>\n<p>We do get user feedback all of the time, we do read them and see what people are saying about the product. We have customer care that people reach out to, and we learn a lot through those channels. Something like speed and performance isn’t something that can really be articulated. If users are happy with your product, and your product is speedy and easy, they will change their behavior.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Iterative design. Tell us how launching things more often beats big yearly redesigns.</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: I was not directly involved in the 2010 Mail design. I’ve taken on my new role as taking on mobile. I will say this, you’re starting to see a lot of the guiding principles that we focus on coming to light in these products.</p>\n<p>We’re really actually focusing on the user and ensuring that we’re bringing out high-quality products with great design and performance. Also, we’re raising the bar on ourselves. We’re following a much more rapid cadence with iterating on our products now.</p>\n<p>There’s lots of other things going on.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Your role is new. Can you tell us more about it?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: My group is called “Emerging products and technology” – we brought together our mobile teams, any product that has a mobile component. Flickr and our connected TV platform. Bringing those three together as a focus is about these shifts in behaviors. People are engaging with all different forms of devices and we wanted teams to engage with our products on them.</p>\n<p>Personally, I came to Yahoo! a little over a year ago through the acquisition of IntoNow, a second screen application. I previously worked at Google as well, and did another startup called Auditude that Adobe acquired. Marissa created this role about a month ago.</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p>So here you have a golden opportunity for Yahoo! to grab marketshare in any number of verticals. Mail is clearly the focus right now, as it’s one of the most-used, fully-owned products at Yahoo’s disposal. Can it do the job right? Can it really bring an experience that keeps users happy, as well as potentially pull others away? Those are questions that need time to be answered.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Yahoo! Mail is starting to a look a little like Gmail, and that’s not a bad thing. Simple is better, especially when it comes to something like email, which nobody likes to do.</p>\n<p>What I can say is that for a lot of Yahoo’s products, there’s only one way to go, and that’s up. Make no mistake though, there is a long, long road ahead for Yahoo! Will it be paved in purple and gold? Stay tuned.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: GigaOm]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n January 1, 1994\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n December 4, 1996, Nasdaq:YHOO \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Yahoo was founded in 1994 by Stanford Ph.D. students David Filo and Jerry Yang.

It uses cues like contact info including phone numbers, and potentially also iMessage email addresses to see who’s reaching out, and then selects an image to display partly at random, and partly based on weighted scores assigned to the frequency of any one image’s use, star ratings, and even information about location, date and time.</p>\n<p>It would be a small change, but a very neat one in practice. In theory, such a system would know to show you a picture of a friend at home in San Francisco if it detects that a call is coming from there. It could also show a snapshot of you and a significant other on vacation in New York City, if the phone detected that you were travelling there while receiving a phone call from home. The system can also display photos from approximately the same time of day as that of the origin call, which would actually be a handy visual shortcut to realize that someone on the other side of the world might be calling you very early in the morning or very early at night, regardless of what time it is locally.</p>\n<p>The system also could pick pictures based on which ones you’ve rated highly via a star system like the one Apple uses in Aperture and iPhoto, and even describes being able to serve small video clips in place of static images where appropriate. You can imagine it being applied not only to incoming phone calls, but also to SMS, iMessage and FaceTime communications.</p>\n<p>The patent was originally filed for in 2010, so Apple has had some time to work on the tech, and we haven’t seen any suggestion of its arrival in iOS as of yet. Patents are rarely good indicators of actual shipping product plans, but this is one that could put a unique, personal spin on a fairly standardized piece of the mobile phone experience, so here’s hoping we see some version of it make its way to Apple’s mobile devices.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n April 1, 1976\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n NASDAQ:AAPL \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Started by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple has expanded from computers to consumer electronics over the last 30 years, officially changing their name from Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple, Inc. in January 2007.\nAmong the key offerings from Apple’s product line are: Pro line laptops (MacBook Pro) and desktops (Mac Pro), consumer line laptops (MacBook Air) and desktops (iMac), servers (Xserve), Apple TV, the Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server operating systems, the iPod, the...</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:49 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Apple Patents Intelligent Caller ID That Turns Inbound Communication Into A Contextual Trip Down Memory Lane"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:06:49 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ct91P18nZ44/"], ["uuid", "d625dc00-25f3-0130-4627-60c547060a7c"]]

At the time, the company noted that this latest big sweep would mainly affect those with larger follower counts, or those who had purchased fake followers. The majority (99 percent) of users would lose fewer than 10 followers, Pinterest said. Today, we have some figures on what those drops looked like, at least in terms of their affect on top Pinterest accounts.</p>\n<p>According to Lyle Dennis, co-creator of Pinterest user directory Top Pinterest Users, the top 10 most followed Pinterest users saw around a 20 percent decline in follower numbers immediately after the Pinterest purge. For example, the top Pinterest user (Joy Cho / Oh Joy!) had 12 million-plus followers before the clean out, and dropped to under 10 million afterwards. She has since gained again, and as of today sits at 10,124,648 followers.</p>\n<p>Dennis says he didn’t keep historical data on-hand for the larger Pinterest user base – he just happened to have noticed the changes thanks to a screencap of the Pinterest top 10 which was posted to a social media news blog just before the spam crackdown.</p>\n<p>Looking at the numbers again today, which have climbed again for some users since the purge, you can see that the event impacted the rankings, and even booted one user out of the top 10 entirely.

They were one of the early companies to experiment with midcore gaming on the Facebook platform. But like many other developers, they pivoted toward iOS and Android when user acquisition became expensive and complicated on the Facebook platform.</p>\n<p>“We partnered with Kabam almost a year ago to deliver incredible games for The Hobbit trilogy, arguably one of the top intellectual properties in the world,” Tsujihara said in a statement. “As we worked with Kabam, it became clear that a closer, more strategic partnership made sense for us both. Kabam is a leader in the industry and we look forward to being a part of their continued growth.”</p>\n<p>Kabam is already at work on another Hobbit title that’s currently in beta.

(Dec. 11, 2012) – Go Daddy, the world’s largest provider of Web hosting, domain name registrations and new SSL Certificates, today announced Blake Irving, formerly a long time Microsoft executive and Chief Product Officer of Yahoo! Incorporated (“Yahoo”), will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), effective January 7, 2013.  Irving will succeed Scott Wagner, a Member of KKR who has been serving as interim CEO since July.\n“Go Daddy, the industry leader of Web hosting solutions for small and medium businesses, is poised for a promising future,” said Go Daddy Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons. “Blake Irving’s deep technology experience and his history of developing new cutting-edge products and leading large global teams make him an enormously compelling choice to drive Go Daddy to the next level of its domestic and global growth.  Go Daddy has made great strides with Scott Wagner as CEO, and we look forward to building on that in the future.”\nGo Daddy has recently been expanding its market-leading products to support its nearly 11 million customers, mostly small business customers both domestically and internationally.  This summer, Go Daddy acquired Outright.com, a cloud-based financial management application and the company also formed a partnership with DudaMobile to launch mobile Website Builder, a service that automates the integration of Web and mobile sites to save businesses time and expand their customer reach.\n“I’m honored for the opportunity to lead such a talented team and to be a part of such an innovative company,” Blake Irving said. “Go Daddy is and will continue to be the hub where businesses can come to life, grow and prosper. We strive to be the global resource that fuels success for countless entrepreneurs and innovators around the world. As a long time Go Daddy customer, I have seen firsthand an organization that is committed to its customers 24 hours a day and seven days a week and yet there still remains much more we can do to enhance the customer experience. This is a fantastic opportunity, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running in January.”\n“Go Daddy is fortunate to have Blake Irving join the team for the next chapter in his long time career as an innovator,” said Scott Wagner, Go Daddy’s Interim CEO. “I’m thrilled for Blake and I am thrilled for Go Daddy. We have good momentum on product and our international growth and having someone with Blake’s talent and character lead the company will only accelerate it.”\nAbout Blake Irving\nBlake Irving has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of Go Daddy, effective January 7, 2013, and will also join the Go Daddy Board of Directors.\nIrving most recently served as Chief Product Officer at Yahoo!

International math and science test results were thrust upon the news cycle today and opportunistic policymakers are decrying the inevitable doom America will face without a superior education system. Yet, levelheaded statisticians have attempted to argue why it’s silly to compare the U.S. to the rest of the world. America is 300 million people strong; there’s more variation between states than between competitor countries. For instance, in Massachusetts, home of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the average 8th Grader scores higher in science than their Japanese and Chinese counterparts.</p>\n<p>First, some background.</p>\n<p>The Olympics of education, the quadrennial Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study TIMSS, ranks the world’s education systems by the analytical prowess of their nation’s adorable 4th and 8th Grade minds. The most notable findings</p>\n Asia dominated the world, with Singapore, Korea, China and Japan vastly outscoring everyone else on most measures\nThe U.S. is better than average (hooray!). Most of the Asian nations and Slovenia, Finland, and Russia all bested America’s 8th grade scientists.\nAs for America’s unfortunate race disparity, blacks and Hispanics continue to lag behind whites and Asians (specifically Asians &gt; whites &gt; Hispanic &gt; black).\nPoverty is a powerful predictor of performance. In Alabama schools where 75% or more students received discounted lunch, 8th Grade math scores were below the averages of Iran, Azerbaijan, and Armenia.\n <p>All of this might justify some nervous hand wringing, if it weren’t for the fact that the United States has never ranked at the top of International test scores, despite being the preeminent innovative force for nearly a century. International comparisons are statistically silly for two very important reasons.</p>\n<p>First, as I and others have argued before, the top slice of students, those who build companies and earn advanced degrees, are responsible for most of the influential innovations. The United States has, in terms of absolute numbers, twice as many top performing students than Japan and attracts 17% of the worlds international students (far more than 2nd-place Britain, at 5%).</p>\n<p>Second, the United States is enormous. Most major countries, from Iran to Germany, either outperform and underperform depending on which US state they’re being compared to.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the TIMSS report went out of its way to separate education “systems” from “countries,” precisely because our national obsession with comparing countries is statistically bogus (for a more thorough take on this view, read here).</p>\n<p>Poverty, race, and opportunity are every bit as important to the educational success of students as what they do while sitting in class. If we want to improve a nation’s intellectual and entrepreneurial spirit, it will take much more than memorizing facts.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:15:11 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Kazakhstan Beats Alabama On Science Tests.

The new design, says Google, will make the service feel “even more natural and fluid on tablet devices.”</p>\n<p>Specifically, Google News product manager Mayuresh Saoji writes in today’s announcement, the new design adds “more breathing room between articles, making it easier to spot the stories you really care about.”</p>\n<p>The service, which according to Google drives over six billion pageviews per month to the news sites it links, is also getting a few smaller feature updates on tablets. You can now, for example, use gestures to “find new articles, news sources, and even topics of interest with intuitive gestures.” Swiping horizontally, for example, allows you to switch between sections.</p>\n<p>Similar to a feature that’s already available on the web, tapping “Explore in depth” on your tablet now also brings up other articles and information related to a particular story.</p>\n<p>Today’s update follows a number of small changes the company made to the Google News tablet experience earlier this year, including the new navigation menu at the top of the Google News page that’s now become a standard design feature of a number of other Google products as well.</p>\n<p>For the time being, this update will only be available to users in the U.S. and is scheduled to roll out slowly over the next few days.

International math and science test results were thrust upon the news cycle today and opportunistic policymakers are decrying the inevitable doom America will face without a superior education system. Yet, levelheaded statisticians have attempted to argue why it’s silly to compare the U.S. to the rest of the world. America is 300 million people strong; there’s more variation between states than between competitor countries. For instance, in Massachusetts, home of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the average 8th Grader scores higher in science than their Japanese and Chinese counterparts.</p>\n<p>First, some background.</p>\n<p>The Olympics of education, the quadrennial Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study TIMSS, ranks the world’s education systems by the analytical prowess of their nation’s adorable 4th and 8th Grade minds. The most notable findings</p>\n Asia dominated the world, with Singapore, Korea, China and Japan vastly outscoring everyone else on most measures\nThe U.S. is better than average (hooray!). Most of the Asian nations and Slovenia, Finland, and Russia all bested America’s 8th grade scientists.\nAs for America’s unfortunate race disparity, blacks and Hispanics continue to lag behind whites and Asians (specifically Asians &gt; whites &gt; Hispanic &gt; black).\nPoverty is a powerful predictor of performance. In Alabama schools where 75% or more students received discounted lunch, 8th Grade math scores were below the averages of Iran, Azerbaijan, and Armenia.\n <p>All of this might justify some nervous hand wringing, if it weren’t for the fact that the United States has never ranked at the top of International test scores, despite being the preeminent innovative force for nearly a century. International comparisons are statistically silly for two very important reasons.</p>\n<p>First, as I and others have argued before, the top slice of students, those who build companies and earn advanced degrees, are responsible for most of the influential innovations. The United States has, in terms of absolute numbers, twice as many top performing students than Japan and attracts 17% of the worlds international students (far more than 2nd-place Britain, at 5%).</p>\n<p>Second, the United States is enormous. Most major countries, from Iran to Germany, either outperform and underperform depending on which US state they’re being compared to.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the TIMSS report went out of its way to separate education “systems” from “countries,” precisely because our national obsession with comparing countries is statistically bogus (for a more thorough take on this view, read here).</p>\n<p>Poverty, race, and opportunity are every bit as important to the educational success of students as what they do while sitting in class. If we want to improve a nation’s intellectual and entrepreneurial spirit, it will take much more than memorizing facts.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:17 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Kazakhstan Beats Alabama On Science Tests.

If you’re not already, soon, you’ll be doing the same. Yes, a huge part of this is that it’s a device that is always with you. But recently, there’s something else I’ve noticed too.</p>\n<p>For a few services out there, I far prefer to use their apps instead of their websites. What’s interesting is that I don’t mean service that only exist as mobile apps or were built to be mobile first, I mean services that have been around for a while but have now nailed their mobile experience.</p>\n<p>These services started on the web, but have evolved to be much more interesting as mobile applications. Two easy examples: Tumblr and Facebook.</p>\n<p>Everyone knows that Facebook dropped the ball with regard to mobile for a long time. While the mobile usage numbers were growing, the product simply wasn’t very good. They went back to the drawing board with a “native” mindset and made what is actually a very good app. An app so good in fact, that it’s far better than their often slow, bloated website.</p>\n<p>I rarely use Facebook through facebook.com anymore. Instead, I chat with people through Messenger on mobile (both the stand-alone app and within the Facebook app), tag people and locations from the app, upload pictures from the app, and pretty much everything else. It’s a better and faster Facebook in just about every way.</p>\n<p>Tumblr is less straightforward because the site is still very good in that it’s performant and relatively non-cluttered. But with the most recent update to their iOS app, I find myself not wanting to visit tumblr.com while I’m at the computer and instead waiting to use the service until I’m on my phone (or iPad, which is just the iPhone version scaled-up since they still don’t have an iPad version).</p>\n<p>It’s something that’s almost hard to describe, but I now find myself with a sort of mental block from using these services on the web. I have this desire to close my laptop and get on my phone — even if I’m sitting at my desk — to use the services there. On mobile, they’re just a joy to use, better than the websites from which they sprung.</p>\n<p>Some of this is a native code vs. HTML debate. (Tumblr recently remove all HTML from the iOS app.) But what makes these apps great is the performance optimization that the native code allows for mixed with re-worked user experiences for the mobile screen.</p>\n<p>Within Tumblr’s app, for example, you can hold down the reblog button for a few seconds and it will reblog any post for you without you having to click any other buttons. You can also pinch to open images full screen and move them around. And there are other hidden gems such as sliding the compose button upwards to reveal the camera for quick photo taking and posting. You just can’t do things like that on a computer.</p>\n<p>Nor would you want to. Captain Obvious: the mobile device is a different beast than a computer. Yes, they’re both technically computers in a sense, but form factors, available resources, and operating systems matter, amongst other things.</p>\n<p>For a long time, services were simply trying to port their websites over to mobile apps. The results mainly sucked. This opened a huge door to “mobile first” startups, and there’s still clearly all the opportunity in the world there because again, everyone is going to be using mobile devices more and computers less.</p>\n<p>This is and will continue to be the future for a long time to come. (Though here’s one good counter-argument.)</p>\n<p>But any service that already has a site would be wise to develop their mobile apps from scratch, perhaps even as more of a separate startup within the company. Think about what people love to do with your service at a fundamental level, but don’t put too much weight into how they’re doing those things on the web. In fact, don’t put any weight into it. Start anew. Get creative. Delight.</p>\n<p>This is a huge opportunity because it allows services that may already have some traction to leverage that into becoming a what I’ll cheekily rephrase as a “mobile burst” startup. That is, a service that may not have started on mobile, but one that is going to thrive on mobile.</p>\n<p>I bet there are a huge amount of such services out there right now — massive beasts laying mainly dormant under the warm, comforting blanket of the web. Unleash them.</p>\n<p>Disclosure: see my disclosures here. But for this post in particular, know that the venture capital firm where I’m a general partner, CrunchFund, owns shares of both Tumblr and Facebook. Tumblr, because I’m fucking addicted to it — especially on mobile now. Facebook, because investors were stupid enough to push it down to $19-a-share so I couldn’t in good conscience not buy it as a rational investor (and we own additional shares through an acquisition of one of our companies).</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:19 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Mobile Burst"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:19 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/XyoJP0OyKrQ/"], ["uuid", "dc56dd70-25f5-0130-462e-60c547060a7c"]]

Hardiman also tells us that The Times had been experimenting with a few of today’s “new” features like the text-to-speech functionality and voice-enabled commenting option over the past few months, and, after adding some polish to those items, have included those items in today’s update.</p>\n<p>In terms of the visual style of the application, the native design elements introduced in the September app redesign are still present. This includes the main action bar and article multi-select feature (used for sharing or building customized article “playlists”). The most noticeable visual change for users will actually be new the new, dynamic interface. On the phone, articles are laid out in one column and images are restricted to small and medium-sized crops, while on tablet devices, the layouts have multiple columns, larger images and scaled typography.</p>\n<p>Subscription pricing remains unchanged: a subscription to NYTimes.com + smartphone apps is $15; with tablet apps it’s $20; and all-digital access is $35; home subscribers have unlimited access to all the above). The Times says it doesn’t break out its digital subscriber numbers by device, but as of Q3 2012, it had 566,000 paid subscribers to its various digital subscription packages, e-readers, and replica editions of The New York Times and its global edition, The International Herald Tribune.</p>\n<p>News of the Android relaunch follows the release of an HTML5-optimized version of The Times in October – a move clearly meant to route around Apple’s Newsstand (and Apple’s cut).</p>\n<p>Catering To The Digital Crowd</p>\n<p>Optimizing for the tablet isn’t just a good move to enhance the user experience, however. A Pew Research study recently found that tablet owners tend to read for longer periods, and delve into more in-depth articles. Tablet owners spend an average of 51 minutes on news, the report said, while smartphone owners spend 54 minutes. But those who own both devices, read for 64 minutes on the tablet, and 54 minutes on their smartphones. 69 percent of tablet owners also read a full article when browsing through headlines, the report found. These are precisely the kinds of users The Times, and all news media organizations, for that matter, need to cater to.</p>\n<p>Another Pew study, released today, also speaks to the growing number of young readers who consume news digitally. The numbers revealed are both good and bad for paywalled news organizations like The NYT. Young adults rival or surpass older generations as news consumers, Pew says. 37 percent of smartphone owners ages 18 to 29 get news on their devices daily, while 40 percent of those 30 to 49 do. In the higher age brackets, 31 percent of those 50 to 64 read on mobile and 25 percent of the 60+ crowd do as well.</p>\n<p>Younger readers are also more likely to share news they read on mobile or tablet, and engage with ads. Those ages 18 to 29 were twice as likely to “at least sometimes” touch an ad on a tablet than those ages 30 to 49.</p>\n<p>Good so far, but…</p>\n<p>Pew also found that paying users tended to be the older crowd – those over 50 were more likely to have a print/digital combo: 20 percent did, while only 12 percent of those under 50 also do. And only 9 percent of the under 50 group said they had digital-only subscriptions.</p>\n<p>The updated NYT app is live now in Google Play here.</p>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:24 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "The New York Times Relaunches On Android With Support For More Tablet Sizes, New Text-To-Speech Feature"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:24 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ftgdoki13lU/"], ["uuid", "deeb2160-25f5-0130-4630-60c547060a7c"]]

Today, Microsoft is giving the social sidebar a bit of a facelift by removing the dark gray background and making the overall design more streamlined and less cluttered.</p>\n<p>While Microsoft doesn’t emphasize this in its announcement, the new layout also seems to put a stronger emphasis on images by offering larger thumbnails for Facebook photos, for example.</p>\n<p>What the Bing team does note, though, is that users don’t have to hover over a friend’s avatar anymore to see additional content. Instead, all of the info is now available right in the sidebar. There is also now a “+ see all” icon that gives you access to even more social results. Microsoft also says the new design means there is less blank space on the page.</p>\n<p>One design element that seems to be gone in this redesign is the “Ask friends” box at the top of the search social sidebar. Bing replaced this with a Facebook “post” button that works about the same, but doesn’t include the call to action.</p>\n<p>These changes will roll out over the next few days, so it may take a while before you will see them when you search on Bing.</p>\n<p>The social sidebar, of course, is a key feature of Bing. Over time, though, Microsoft kept adding new services to it and it often felt rather cluttered. The new design removes a lot of this clutter, and the fact that it’s now flush with the rest of the results also makes the sidebar feel more like an integral part of the search experience.</p>\n<p>Just yesterday, it’s worth noting, Microsoft added some interesting new features to its Knowledge Graph-like snapshot feature, which occupies the middle column on the Bing search results pages. Unlike Google, though, which seems to be in the process of slowly de-emphasizing its social search efforts in favor of its Knowledge Graph results, Bing continues to mostly focus on its social search results.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Bing is a decision (search) engine from Microsoft officially announced on May 28, 2009.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Earlier today, after nearly a year in development, Omada Health launched to bring diabetes prevention online in an effort to help fight obesity in the U.S. NatureBox wants to do its part, too, and has announced that it has closed $2 million in seed funding to accelerate its business and help anyone and everyone discover healthier eating options.</p>\n<p>The investment is co-led by General Catalyst Partners and Redpoint Ventures and includes participation from a number of angel investors. Founded in 2011 and launched in January 2012, NatureBox has grown its subscriber base by 50 to 100 percent month-over-month and now has over 250K visits per month to its website, co-founder Gautam Gupta tells us.</p>\n<p>But what is this NatureBox all about? Simply put, NatureBox is looking to create a Trader Joe’s for the Web — or a Birchbox for organic foods, if you prefer. In other words, the company distributes its own brand of nutritionist-approved health foods, sending them to subscribers via box. The idea is to take the hassle (and guesswork) out of buying health snack foods, making those that are typically difficult to find in stores easily accessible online to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>The inspiration for NatureBox evolved from Gupta’s personal struggle with obesity throughout his childhood and the time spent early in his career as a VC at General Catalyst. Weighing in at over 210 pounds by age 12, Gupta lost 70 pounds through healthy eating and by the time he was 19 had landed an internship at the VC firm. And by the time he was a senior in college, he was fully immersed in the world of venture capital and had begun to focus on e-commerce investments.</p>\n<p>“NatureBox’s mission is personal to me,” the co-founder tells TechCrunch. After Gupta discovered that snack foods actually represented a $64 billion market and that there was tremendous market opportunity in providing a convenient way for consumers to get healthier foods that they couldn’t find at their local grocery store.</p>\n<p>According to Gupta, children and adults are snacking three times more than they did 30 years ago and consuming a third of their daily calories from snacks. Gupta believes that this is what caused his own struggles with obesity and thinks that it could have been prevented had he had access to healthier choices.</p>\n<p>He and co-founder Ken Chen (a friend from college and real estate investor) incubated the company with their own money and “began generating significant revenue at the outset,” Gupta says, before seeking out VC investment. With the new funding raised, NatureBox plans to expand its customer base and continue to grow its healthy foods brand. It will also use the new injection of capital to beef up its website and its staff and scale operations to meet growing demand.</p>\n<p>The company’s “private-labeled” snacks are hand picked each month and delivered in a recyclable snack box, and each includes 15 to 20 servings of four to six items, which have been “curated” by a nutritionist based on a seasonal health and wellness theme, Gupta tells us. In October, for example, the box was nicknamed “Antioxidant Trifecta” and included a combo of dark-skinned berries, raw nuts and dark chocolate. The snacks are sourced from local growers and indie food suppliers across the U.S. Every snack, the co-founder says, is free from high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, trans fats and artificial sweeteners, flavors and colors.</p>\n<p>Those interested can learn more at NatureBox.com. Oh, and another incentive to check it out? If the organic foods aren’t enough, for every box that the company delivers, like TOMS Shoes, it donates a meal to feed the hungry in the U.S. through partner organizations.</p>\n \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:31 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "NatureBox Lands $2M From General Catalyst, Redpoint To Go Big With Its “Birchbox For Healthy Foods”"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:31 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/p_W2MypREU8/"], ["uuid", "e33d1880-25f5-0130-4633-60c547060a7c"]]

The company wants to build better research and analytics tools for lawyers, in a way that dramatically changes the landscape of legal software, which Judicata founder Blake Masters describes as “notoriously inefficient and outdated” in a blog post announcing the news.</p>\n<p>Judicata’s mission is ambitious, which is likely why it hasn’t been undertaken in quite the same way before. Masters argues that previous attempts have only addressed symptoms and offshoots of the problems facing legal software and how it works for lawyers. Instead, the startup wants to take the mass of unstructured data represented by the body of case law that exists, and turn it into something structured, searchable and fully, properly indexed for targeted use. Judicata’s mission involves what it calls “mapping the legal genome,” which is a fancy way of saying it hopes to combine algorithmic, machine learning approaches to ingesting the mass of legal data and turning out something useful with careful human review to guarantee the accuracy of results.</p>\n<p>Masters uses Palantir as an analog, comparing that software’s ability to parse data to identify patterns that can help a human analyst make informed decisions to what its software can do for practicing lawyers. So it’s not a magic bullet, or an infallible virtual lawyer bot, but instead a refined tool that goes beyond clumsy approaches like full-text keyword search of archived PDF versions of paper decisions. Judicata will help lawyers by providing them with reasonable expectations about how, given the history of precedent available, decisions could or likely will go, and what they can do to sway the course of that probable ruling to make it more in line with their own desired outcome.</p>\n<p>The Judicata team, besides having some big-name early investors on board, also boasts impressively-skilled co-founders including Itai Gurari who helped build Google Scholar’s legal search. It’s still keeping product under wraps, but the fact that it has raised this funding without even a shipping product reflects the size and potential of the problem it aims to address.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n January 23, 2012\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Judicata is mapping the legal genome—i.e. using highly specialized case law parsing and algorithmically assisted human review to turn unstructured court opinions into structured data.

The difference, says Co-Founder Nada Aldahleh, is the flexibility that the service gains by allowing for a more iterative project management.</p>\n<p>Aldahleh uses the term “infinite grids” to describe how Sandglaz can be broken down into adjustable milestones. A customer has the capability to break down task lists, add descriptions, and set notifications and due dates. Tasks are through a simple drag and drop feature.</p>\n<p>In her last job Aldahlel managed the transition from the traditional waterfall development methodology to an Agile process. Through that work came the idea and the initial development for the service.</p>\n<p>Sandglaz needs baking. They plan to do an email integration and develop apps for the Android and the iPhone. Customers are requesting a universal grid so they can get a first view of all their different projects at one time.

It is the largest seed round ever for a YC company, topping Funders Club, which raised $6 million in October.</p>\n<p>ZenPayroll executives did not disclose the lead investors. A spokesperson wrote in an email that there were several who have been actively involved with the company, so it didn’t make sense to call out a specific one. When the company does its next round of financing, it will be a traditional venture capital lead round.</p>\n<p>Here’s a partial list of investors:</p>\n Pejman Nozad\nAaron Levie, CEO and Co-Founder at Box\nData Collective\nDavid Sacks, CEO and Co-Founder, Yammer\nDrew Houston, CEO and Co-Founder, Dropbox\nGoogle Ventures\nJawed Karim, Co-Founder, YouTube\nJeremy Stoppelman, CEO and co-founder, Yelp\nKris Duggan, CEO and Co-Founder, Badgeville\nLarry Augustin, CEO, SugarCRM\nSalesforce.com\nSherpalo Ventures\nTien Tzuo, CEO and Co-Founder, Zuora\n <p>Reeves said ZenPayroll will offer a service that is easier to use than what is offered by ADP and Paychex, the two heavyweights in the payroll market that have a combined market value of $38 billion.</p>\n<p>The payroll market is prime for disruption. ADP and Paychex serve large companies but the smaller ones are still managing payroll like they did 50 years ago. Reeves says the service is designed for small businesses that increasingly do not have a corporate office and still, for the most part, manually do their own payroll. He says about 6 million businesses do their own payroll, with half managing it on paper and spreadsheets. The company will operate under a SaaS model. The cost is $25 per month and $4 per month for each employee. When a company grows to ten employees, the cost drops to $1 per employee per month.</p>\n<p>He said it takes about 10 minutes for a customer to sign up on ZenPayroll and gain access to the dashboard. In contrast, ADP requires technical knowledge that calls for a level of training that is not uncommon with legacy solutions.</p>\n<p>Once signed up, the customer decides the payment schedule. Benefits can be added along with bonuses and reimbursements. Payroll taxes are automatically calculated and paid. Government payroll reports and documents are filled out and made ready to approve.</p>\n<p>ZenPayroll now supports full- and part-time employees. Contractors will be supported early next year.</p>\n<p>ZenPayroll raised its seed round in April and has taken the time since then to develop the technology, fill out the team — which includes engineers from Stanford and veterans of the payroll industry — and to start building a customer base. It has about 50 customers and processes several million dollars in payroll.</p>\n<p>In an email interview, Box’s Aaron Levie compared ZenPayroll to the powerhouse SaaS players that have generated billions in value over the past 10 years:</p>\n Here’s why I’m so excited about ZenPayroll…  First off, they’ve already assembled an amazing team: the caliber of people attacking this problem is unprecedented for the space. Second, it’s rare that you find a $10B+ category with this level of opportunity — it’s a market led by incumbents who have been around for decades that generally lack modern user experiences and business models. ZenPayroll is positioned to do for payroll what Salesforce did for CRM and Workday did for HCM. Furthermore, thanks to their delivery model and focus on simplicity, they’ll make payroll technology accessible to smaller businesses that still run off manual processes, expanding the market dramatically. \n<p>ZenPayroll comes at a time when the infrastructure of the modern back office is becoming an ecosystem of its own. Electronic signatures and digital fax services are replacing the manual processes of the back office. Tablets and smartphones give small business people flexibility without needing to have an office. The cloud makes it possible to rapidly update services with no applications to download and launch.</p>\n<p>Startups like ZenPayroll have tremendous potential, but the challenge will come with the fragmented small business market. Most small businesses have little knowledge or the time to think about new systems for conducting their business. Education is still critical. Reeves said that partnerships with accountants will be one strategy to reach the small business market. But that may be tough, as well.

The updates, six months in development, are meant to increase focus on analytics and third-party integrations, encouraging users to post to Buffer across the web, instead of visiting the website itself.</p>\n<p>According to Buffer co-founder Leo Widrich, the biggest change today is that the company is no longer trying to make either the web or iPhone app a dashboard – meaning a destination for people to add content. Instead, he says, the company wants them to add content through Buffer’s integrations across the web.</p>\n<p>The reasoning behind today’s changes has to do with the fact that, following the release of the Buffer API in August, over 40 percent of Buffer’s updates were posted through the API and buttons, and this trend continues to grow today. The company wants to push that number closer to 100 percent if possible. “We heavily try to discourage people to add to Buffer through the web app or iPhone app,” says Widrich.</p>\n<p>With the new web app, Buffer’s redesign increases the focus on other features, like analytics, managing the updates queue, and discovering more apps where Buffer is integrated. Specifically, the web application now allows you to copy updates from one stream across to other social accounts (e.g. drag-and-drop updates from your Twitter account to your Facebook); it introduces a “shuffle” option to let Buffer’s algorithm randomize the order; it now lets you discover your top posts via the improved analytics section and copy them directly to another social account; and it lets you reorder your profiles more easily.</p>\n<p>The company also updated the iPhone app, which not only complements Buffer’s web application, but can also stand independently, never requiring use of the web at all. You can now connect all your social accounts from within the app, upload and Buffer images directly in the app, and see more detailed analytics (mentions, likes, comments – when before it only supported clicks and retweets). It also offers a media-rich preview of your queue, including images, videos, and link previews.</p>\n<p>Widrich says that today, 10,000 websites carry the Buffer button, and it’s now integrated in over 50 app integrations, including Reeder, Pocket, Feedly and more. Of the 410,000 Buffer users, around 10 percent (44,566) have installed the iPhone app, a number Widrich hopes will grow with today’s update. The Android app will be available in Q1 2013.</p>\n<p>Overall, Buffer users are consistently engaged, with 30 percent of the 410,000 active monthly, 20 percent weekly and 10 percent daily. The company also now has 7,000 paid subscribers and a revenue run rate of $900,000.</p>\n<p>Widrich is also excited to report that the Buffer team of seven have gotten their Visas and is now heading back to the U.S. next week. (You may remember that, in December last year, the team raised $400,000 in angel funding, but had to head back to Europe because of immigration laws.)</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n October 12, 2010\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $400k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Buffer is a smarter way to share pictures, links or videos on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.\nJust drop everything worth sharing in your Buffer and it will be posted for you well spaced out over the day, at a better time. \nIt works from anywhere, with lots of app integrations, browser extensions and shortcuts!</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:43 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "With Over 400,000 Users, Social Media Manager Buffer Gets A Refresh On Web & Mobile, Moves Away From Being A Destination Site"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:43 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/gSMkA-x04QE/"], ["uuid", "ea9e9b60-25f5-0130-4639-60c547060a7c"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Oh, Yahoo! Mail. It’s one of those products that many of us used at one point, and it either stuck or didn’t. For a lot of users it did stick, as it is currently the No. 3 mail product on the web, behind Microsoft and Google’s products, of course.</p>\n<p>Today, the company announced a redesign across all platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone and web. Internally, the company called it the “Cuatro” release, for obvious reasons. I had a chance to speak with Adam Cahan, SVP, Emerging Products &amp; Tech, at Yahoo!, who is in a role that’s just a month old, set up by its CEO Marissa Mayer.</p>\n<p>We talked about today’s release, and how Yahoo! is entering a shift into iterative product design and maintenance, letting user feedback and usage patterns guide their way. This is nothing new as far as products go, but for Yahoo!, this might be a complete cultural shift.</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Can you tell us a bit about this launch?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: I think the most important piece is that we’re really focusing on the user behaviors and what users are here to do with email. The funny line we’re using internally is “we want to re-imagine email to be email.” When it comes to email, what you want is fast and easy, anywhere access. What we learned is that speed and simplicity are features, and that’s what users are trusting us with. We spent a lot of time not only on the details of the performance here, but also watching how it impacts everyone. We do a lot of bucket testing to see what happens.</p>\n<p>It takes a tiny bit of time for users to re-adapt, then we observe behavior. What we’ve found is that we’re getting more of their time.</p>\n<p>In terms of mobile, people expect that their products and providers are available anywhere they go. For email, it’s important for our users to have access to that.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Tell us about the cross-platform approach to your products, specifically something like Mail.</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: There’s a tremendous amount of nuance on every platform. Folks have been using webmail, so they come to expect certain things from Yahoo! and expect consistently. Each platform has its own subtlety. Nobody wants Mail on iOS and Android to act the same way. Our principles carry across though.</p>\n<p>For iPhone, infinite scroll is something that’s there. In the same way, for Android, we focus on screen density, seeing how many things you can display on a single screen. These are metaphors you see across devices. On Windows 8, we’re emphasizing things like Snap view and tiles, which are a new thing.</p>\n<p>The big emphasis is when we focus on these questions about users’ daily habits and what they’re doing on a regular basis, you start to see how small improvements on performance impact their daily life.</p>\n<p>The metric we know from the web release is that we’re saving 36 million minutes a day, which are tremendously meaningful minutes. That’s the scale of impact. We’re watching performance by the seconds and the minutes.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: How do you talk to your users?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: It depends on the nature of the product and design. In the case of something like Mail, you have the classic opportunity for bucket testing. This is where we can test behaviors. We want people to come back to email more, and get more done. It’s a bit more complex on mobile. We’re monitoring true performance there and the core technology: scroll view, battery, and things like that. Very product centric.</p>\n<p>We do get user feedback all of the time, we do read them and see what people are saying about the product. We have customer care that people reach out to, and we learn a lot through those channels. Something like speed and performance isn’t something that can really be articulated. If users are happy with your product, and your product is speedy and easy, they will change their behavior.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Iterative design. Tell us how launching things more often beats big yearly redesigns.</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: I was not directly involved in the 2010 Mail design. I’ve taken on my new role as taking on mobile. I will say this, you’re starting to see a lot of the guiding principles that we focus on coming to light in these products.</p>\n<p>We’re really actually focusing on the user and ensuring that we’re bringing out high-quality products with great design and performance. Also, we’re raising the bar on ourselves. We’re following a much more rapid cadence with iterating on our products now.</p>\n<p>There’s lots of other things going on.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch: Your role is new. Can you tell us more about it?</p>\n<p>Adam Cahan: My group is called “Emerging products and technology” – we brought together our mobile teams, any product that has a mobile component. Flickr and our connected TV platform. Bringing those three together as a focus is about these shifts in behaviors. People are engaging with all different forms of devices and we wanted teams to engage with our products on them.</p>\n<p>Personally, I came to Yahoo! a little over a year ago through the acquisition of IntoNow, a second screen application. I previously worked at Google as well, and did another startup called Auditude that Adobe acquired. Marissa created this role about a month ago.</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p>So here you have a golden opportunity for Yahoo! to grab marketshare in any number of verticals. Mail is clearly the focus right now, as it’s one of the most-used, fully-owned products at Yahoo’s disposal. Can it do the job right? Can it really bring an experience that keeps users happy, as well as potentially pull others away? Those are questions that need time to be answered.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, Yahoo! Mail is starting to a look a little like Gmail, and that’s not a bad thing. Simple is better, especially when it comes to something like email, which nobody likes to do.</p>\n<p>What I can say is that for a lot of Yahoo’s products, there’s only one way to go, and that’s up. Make no mistake though, there is a long, long road ahead for Yahoo! Will it be paved in purple and gold? Stay tuned.</p>\n<p>[Photo credit: GigaOm]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n January 1, 1994\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n December 4, 1996, Nasdaq:YHOO \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Yahoo was founded in 1994 by Stanford Ph.D. students David Filo and Jerry Yang.

David Maisel, who was the former Chairman of Marvel Studios and the executive producer of Iron Man, remains executive producer of the film. He’s a special adviser to the company. The film will arrive in theaters in summer 2016, or three and a half years from now.</p>\n<p>The fact that Rovio is financing the film itself is not terribly surprising. The company has always done business in an unusual way. Its Series A venture round was $42 million and primarily in secondary liquidity, according to sources familiar with the deal. And the company has embarked on an unusual effort to build hundreds of activity and theme parks around the world. </p>\n<p>Rovio says it is following Marvel Studios’ example in producing and financing films outside the traditional studio system. Because of this, it will get to retain full creative control. </p>\n<p>Cohen also produced Hop, a film from Illumination and Universal last year. Before that, he was the vice president of production at Twentieth Century Fox Animation, and worked with Blue Sky Studios on Ice Age, Robots, Ice Age: The Meltdown and Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who.</p>\n<p>“I’m so excited and honored to be working on this film with Mikael, David, and Rovio’s incredibly talented game developers and artists,” Cohen said in a statement. “From both an entertainment and strategic perspective, Rovio is at the forefront of game innovation and is trailblazing terrific new ways for Angry Birds fans to interact with these characters.”</p>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:51 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Rovio Grabs A Producer And Says It Will Finance The Upcoming Angry Birds Film Itself"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:51 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/3kRY5QT-_u0/"], ["uuid", "ef893190-25f5-0130-463d-60c547060a7c"]]

It uses cues like contact info including phone numbers, and potentially also iMessage email addresses to see who’s reaching out, and then selects an image to display partly at random, and partly based on weighted scores assigned to the frequency of any one image’s use, star ratings, and even information about location, date and time.</p>\n<p>It would be a small change, but a very neat one in practice. In theory, such a system would know to show you a picture of a friend at home in San Francisco if it detects that a call is coming from there. It could also show a snapshot of you and a significant other on vacation in New York City, if the phone detected that you were travelling there while receiving a phone call from home. The system can also display photos from approximately the same time of day as that of the origin call, which would actually be a handy visual shortcut to realize that someone on the other side of the world might be calling you very early in the morning or very early at night, regardless of what time it is locally.</p>\n<p>The system also could pick pictures based on which ones you’ve rated highly via a star system like the one Apple uses in Aperture and iPhoto, and even describes being able to serve small video clips in place of static images where appropriate. You can imagine it being applied not only to incoming phone calls, but also to SMS, iMessage and FaceTime communications.</p>\n<p>The patent was originally filed for in 2010, so Apple has had some time to work on the tech, and we haven’t seen any suggestion of its arrival in iOS as of yet. Patents are rarely good indicators of actual shipping product plans, but this is one that could put a unique, personal spin on a fairly standardized piece of the mobile phone experience, so here’s hoping we see some version of it make its way to Apple’s mobile devices.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n April 1, 1976\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n NASDAQ:AAPL \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Started by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple has expanded from computers to consumer electronics over the last 30 years, officially changing their name from Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple, Inc. in January 2007.\nAmong the key offerings from Apple’s product line are: Pro line laptops (MacBook Pro) and desktops (Mac Pro), consumer line laptops (MacBook Air) and desktops (iMac), servers (Xserve), Apple TV, the Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server operating systems, the iPod, the...</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n </div>\n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:54 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Apple Patents Intelligent Caller ID That Turns Inbound Communication Into A Contextual Trip Down Memory Lane"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:21:54 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/Ct91P18nZ44/"], ["uuid", "f0c98830-25f5-0130-463e-60c547060a7c"]]

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Last week, Pinterest began curtailing the number of spammers and fake accounts on its system, in an effort to clear its platform off unwanted elements. At the time, the company noted that this latest big sweep would mainly affect those with larger follower counts, or those who had purchased fake followers. The majority (99 percent) of users would lose fewer than 10 followers, Pinterest said. Today, we have some figures on what those drops looked like, at least in terms of their affect on top Pinterest accounts.</p>\n<p>According to Lyle Dennis, co-creator of Pinterest user directory Top Pinterest Users, the top 10 most followed Pinterest users saw around a 20 percent decline in follower numbers immediately after the Pinterest purge. For example, the top Pinterest user (Joy Cho / Oh Joy!) had 12 million-plus followers before the clean out, and dropped to under 10 million afterwards. She has since gained again, and as of today sits at 10,124,648 followers.</p>\n<p>Dennis says he didn’t keep historical data on-hand for the larger Pinterest user base – he just happened to have noticed the changes thanks to a screencap of the Pinterest top 10 which was posted to a social media news blog just before the spam crackdown.</p>\n<p>Looking at the numbers again today, which have climbed again for some users since the purge, you can see that the event impacted the rankings, and even booted one user out of the top 10 entirely. Here’s how the numbers have changed for those users before and after the clean out:</p>\n<p>Before:</p>\n Joy Cho/ Oh Joy!: 12,733,689\nBekka Palmer: 8,465,927\nMaryann Rizzo: 8,073,270\nBonnie Tsang: 7,889,295\nJane Wang:  7,514,671\npejper:  6,826,436\nmolly pickering:  6,786,757\nJan of Poppytalk: 6,703,051\nHonestlyWTF: 5,483,892\nOlya Bastet: 5,162,212\n <p>After (as of today):</p>\n Joy Cho/ Oh Joy!: 10,124,648\nJane Wang:  6,876,464\nBekka Palmer: 6,785,853\nMaryann Rizzo: 6,742,899\nBonnie Tsang: 5,911,135\nmolly pickering: 5,435,822\nJan of Poppytalk:  5,410,144\npejper:  5,057,767\nHonestlyWTF:  4,392,324\nChristine Martinez: 4,255,261\n <p>Important, please note!  These “after” numbers are current as of today – at the time when Dennis reported the immediate effects to us, some of the after numbers were even lower, with declines falling into a 20-25 percent range, depending on the user, he says.</p>\n<p>Although the purge likely did only impact these larger user accounts to this extent, it’s a notable sweep, as the website itself only has around 40 million users globally, according to November numbers from comScore.</p>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, the Top Pinterest Users website, also built by Hugo Gameiro, continually checks the top users and boards on Pinterest to ensure its numbers are accurate. However, it does so without using an official API, as Pinterest has not yet released an API publicly at this time. The site also organizes users into various categories, like WeFellow did back in Twitter’s earlier days.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n 2008\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $138M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Pinterest is a social networking site with a visually-pleasing “virtual pinboard” interface.

You go to the JuicyCanvas site and choose a piece of art that you like. Then you can tweak it to your liking, adjusting the size, rotating it, changing the colors, and so on. When you’re done, you can pay JuicyCanvas to print the piece and ship it to you. You can also share your version on social networks.</p>\n<p>The final result, according to a company spokesperson, should be “influenced by the buyer’s own tastes and imagination, but ultimately keeping the core spirit of the artist’s original vision.”</p>\n<p>We’ve written about other companies trying to give people a custom art experience. The most well-known is probably Zazzle, where you can create goods like t-shirts, iPhone cases, and more using custom designs. On the more art-y side, there’s EveryArt, where you can commission a painting tailored to your tastes. But neither of them is doing exactly what JuicyCanvas is doing, and when I brought them up with the spokesperson, he described Zazzle as “the Walmart of customization” and said that EveryArt and similar companies can’t scale, because they’re “stuck in the same 1:1 artist-to-buyer dogma of the ancient art model.”</p>\n<p>JuicyCanvas was founded by the husband-and-wife team of Artur Maklyarevsky and Deb Brugiati. Apparently there’s a lot of personal history that led to the company’s idea, which you can read more about here, but to boil it down, they say, “Their shared love for street art, along with the dream to recreate the magic of those NYC art parties, slowly evolved into what they’re now proud to call JuicyCanvas — the only place on the web where the creative impulse of the novice is married with the genius of the artist.”</p>\n<p>I tried out the customization features for myself, and as I worked, I felt vaguely guilty — like I was taking a perfectly okay piece of art and defacing it. On the other hand, maybe I’m just the equivalent of the old man standing on his lawn and shouting that remixes aren’t real music. After all, playing with the art was fun. And if the guilt becomes too much for you, you can always skip the customization and order the art as-is.</p>\n \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 20:42:00 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "With Custom Art Startup JuicyCanvas, You Add A Personal Touch To Paintings Before You Buy Them"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 20:42:00 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/KlthsM4_W5s/"], ["uuid", "22143e90-2601-0130-4643-60c547060a7c"]]

On Sunday, PayPal Mobile reached its second biggest mobile shopping day of the year, tripling its year-over-year growth in global mobile payment volume compared to the second Sunday in Dec. 2011.</p>\n<p>eBay’s VP of mobile, Steve Yankovich tells us that the company has seen an unprecedented shift in transactions on mobile. He says that currently, one-third of all eBay transactions are “touched” by mobile, meaning users access listings, or post via mobile even if the sale isn’t made on a mobile phone.</p>\n<p>“We’re seeing a change in the way people are shopping because of mobile and this has turned the holiday shopping calendar on its head,” he explains.</p>\n<p>eBay and PayPal are still forecasting over $10 billion in mobile transactions and mobile payments volume, and Yankovich said the these targets will definitely be met.

Or, simply put, the app is something like an iOS version of “Google Now.”</p>\n<p>Google Now, for those unfamiliar, is a feature designed for users of Android devices, which learns from your current search behavior and then proactively provides you with information based on its understanding of you and your interests. It can provide weather information, flight details, sports team updates, traffic updates, calendar events, and more.</p>\n<p>The new Grokr app can do much of the same, but also offers even more by incorporating the info it gathers from your social networking profiles on other networks, like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Meanwhile, Google Now’s understanding is limited to the information gleaned from Google’s own services. Granted, that’s still a truckload of information, but it isn’t necessarily a complete picture.</p>\n<p>The Sunnyvale-based startup has been developing the technology for a couple of years, focused on this idea of reinventing search on mobile. “If you really look at search on a mobile device, it’s an artifact from the old PC world,” says Grokr co-founder and CEO Srivats Sampath. “What they did is they took something that was designed for a PC with a large keyboard, large screen, a mouse, and a person sitting at the desk using 10 fingers, and they took that, miniaturized it, put it on a phone.”</p>\n<p>In thinking about how search could be reinvented for mobile, the team at Grokr focused on several critical areas it wanted to fix. They wanted to make search less of a manual process and more predictive, and they wanted to move search from a keyword-based model to an entity-based one (meaning it wanted to understand the meaning behind words, too).</p>\n<p>The company built Grokr’s own “Knowledge Graph” on top of the same one that Google used: Freebase, a community-contributed facts database. And then, Grokr added to it. “We based it on Freebase,” says Sampath, “then we added another 50 to 75 different data sources. Right now, we have 700 million facts in the database, and we have 25 million entities. Then we built machine-learning algorithms around that. That allowed us to rank those entities,” he explains.</p>\n<p>In addition to data from Freebase, Grokr also sources from external entities like Yelp, Factual, Rovi and many others.</p>\n<p>In layman’s terms, this means Grokr understands the difference between “Taj Mahal” the monument, the singer, and the hotel, and can serve up the most relevant results given its understanding of what the user was really after when searching.</p>\n<p>As for the app itself, while the big draw will be its Google Now-like proactive alerts, it also serves as an alternative search engine (there’s actually a search box in the app which leads to results sourced from the web and Grokr’s understanding of the users). The app also works as something of a personalized news source, too. When you launch Grokr, it customizes the interface to show you local weather, traffic, trending headlines and search terms, movies, and other personal entertainment-focused recommendations like nearby restaurants, bars, parks, and more.</p>\n<p>“We’ve essentially built Google Now for iOS, but what we’ve also done is added more signals than what Google Now has. Google Now primarily uses location and time of day,” says Sampath. “We use location, time of day, your interests, your intent – just a whole bunch of signal to bring forth all this information to you.”</p>\n<p>Like Google Now, Grokr offers traffic info based on your commute patterns and sports updates. It also pushes breaking news alerts to you based on your interests. But when customizing other things – like the news headlines it shows, for example, it pulls in data from your interests (e.g. your headlines might come more from TechCrunch because you “liked” it on Facebook).</p>\n<p>In addition, while today’s app serves as something of a base product, it’s far from being finished. Google Now today offers more types of alerts, with things like package-delivery notifications, restaurant reservations, research topic alerts, and more. Sampath said because Grokr doesn’t yet offer more granular control over notifications, it’s keeping the alerts to a minimum to not bombard the user, but that may change in time. The company  is thinking about how it could incorporate other services in the future, like a user’s calendar or email, for instance. Contacts, however, will not come into play due to user privacy concerns.</p>\n<p>The big picture here is that Grokr is trying to build something of a predictive search engine – no small task, given Google’s dominance in all things search. But the company believes that mobile allows for this kind of opportunity. “Predictive search, based on all the personal, big data…allows us to do all this amazing stuff.”</p>\n<p>He notes that, even the data is personalized and anonymized. They’re not tracking you as an individual here, only you as represented by your interests and behavior. (Not creepy, right?) Down the line, Grokr could even begin to predict things that you want to buy, or it could connect with your health data to offer even more meaningful insight than it does today.</p>\n<p>The iOS app won’t be released until tomorrow, but you can stay tuned here for the launch.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <p>\n \n $2.4M\n </p>\n </div>\n \n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 20:51:14 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Grokr Debuts “Google Now” For iOS Users"], ["updated_at", Tue, 11 Dec 2012 20:51:14 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/KXrL3OtTCvo/"], ["uuid", "6c37c810-2602-0130-4646-60c547060a7c"]]

The deal is meant to sort out issues that Sprint has had in steering the decision-making process of Clearwire’s business sources told the WSJ, and also it would help Sprint acquire the spectrum rights currently owned by Clearwire. Sprint is currently a wholesale customer of Clearwire’s network, along with FreedomPop, NetZero, Cricket, EarthLink and a number of others.</p>\n<p>The WSJ says that despite talks, a deal could be blocked by Japanese carrier SoftBank’s current proposal to acquire a 70 percent majority ownership stake in Sprint, and also by the need for Clearwire’s shareholders to approve the deal. Sprint could attempt to make the deal’s successful closure conditional on the SoftBank deal going through, too, so it’s far from a fait accompli.</p>\n<p>Sprint acquired its majority stake in Clearwire back in late October, increasing its percentage ownership from 48 percent to 50.8 percent. At the time Sprint, made a point of spelling out that the deal did not grant Sprint control over the company, nor did it mean that Clearwire’s financials would be at all combined with Sprint’s. Sprint has also owned more than a 50 percent stake in Clearwire in the past, but backed off last June in a move intended to reduce its liability for Clearwire’s debt obligations at the time, according to Fierce Wireless.</p>\n<p>The SoftBank deal would furnish Sprint with the funds necessary to help it begin to turn around Clearwire’s money-losing business, the WSJ says, something which the company couldn’t take do on its own without significantly affecting its balance sheet. That would pave the way for Sprint to acquire Clearwire’s TD-LTE network and 2.5GHz spectrum ownership, which would give Sprint a key strategic long-term spectrum resource to help build out its network.</p>\n<p>We’ve reached out to both Clearwire and Sprint for additional comment, and will update if we hear back.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <p>\n \n 1999\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n NYSE:S \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Sprint Nextel offers a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications services bringing the freedom of mobility to consumers, businesses and government users.\nSprint Nextel is widely recognized for developing, engineering and deploying innovative technologies, including two wireless networks serving almost 49 million customers at the end of the second quarter of 2009; industry-leading mobile data services; instant national and international push-to-talk capabilities; and a global Tier 1 Internet backbone.</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n October 2003\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n NASDAQ:CLWR \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Clearwire, founded in October 2003 by telecom pioneer Craig O.

The company is today announcing that Pinault Printemps Redoute, the fashion conglomerate, is taking a €10 million investment in Bigfoot I, the Rocket holding company that controls Russian fashion commerce site Lamoda, South American fashion site Dafiti and also has a stake in Namshi, the Samwer’s fashion effort in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>The move is a sign of how established fashion businesses in developed markets are continuing to look for ways of better penetrating emerging markets. It is also a sign of how Rocket continues to pick up big-name backers who support its idea of building e-commerce operations out into markets where other established global players like Amazon or Ebay have yet to make significant moves.</p>\n<p>The cash-for-equity investment appears to be the first made by a fashion company in a Rocket operation.</p>\n<p>“We have come a long way since we launched our site last year, and the fact that we continue to attract significant investment means that we will be able to project that success to coming years,” says Malte Huffmann, Founder &amp; Managing Director Dafiti in an interview with me.</p>\n<p>The news comes just two days after Dafiti raised some $65 million from a consortium of investors to build up its operations in South America, which are based in Brazil but extending elsewhere. Both Dafiti and Lamoda have been amassing double-digit millions investments from the likes of JP Morgan and Summit Partners as they continue to aggressively build out their operations in their markets. Lamoda, which was struggling when it first opened for business, is currently considered to be the fashion e-commerce site to beat in the fast-growing market of Russia, and it is expanding its footprint to more geographies over time.</p>\n<p>More to come.

Prescription Eyewear, the parent company of GlassesDirect.com, high-end myOptique.com and SunglassesShop.com, has acquired LensOn.com, a Northern European leader in selling contact lenses online.</p>\n<p>The financial terms of the deal were not directly disclosed, but to facilitate the acquisition, Prescription Eyewear has raised an additional £12 million ($19.3 million) from Index Ventures and other investors, and I understand that the bulk of that was used for the purchase. </p>\n<p>Index has been very active in the European VC investment market of late. Just earlier today, the customer reviews site Trustpilot announced a €10 million investment led by Index as well. The VC has been very bullish on e-commerce in general, with one of its bigger investments this year leading a $40 million round in L.A. vertically-integrated fashion site Nasty Gal.</p>\n<p>The total funding now raised by Prescription Eyewear is now £32 million, which the company likes to say is on par with what Warby Parker, the upstart, vertically-integrated online eyewear company in the U.S., has raised to date. The combined company expects to have gross retail sales of £30 million ($45 million) in 2012 and says that it is profitable.</p>\n<p>According to Prescription Eyewear’s American CEO Kevin Cornils, the idea behind the purchase of LensOn to to further expand Prescription Eyewar’s portfolio into the area of contact lenses, completing the selection of eyewear it offers to consumers.</p>\n<p>By way of GlassesDirect, Prescription Eyewear was one of the first on the market in Europe to offer online glasses purchasing, and Cornil likes to joke that it was also a good template for Warby Parker, having pioneered years ago the concept of sending several pairs to someone’s house to try out before purchasing. “We would say Warby has been inspired by us,” he said in an interview.</p>\n<p>But similarly, GlassesDirect is taking a page from Warby Parker — Cornils says it is doing “a great job in disrupting the U.S. market with a designer experience but at a much lower price” — and adding more vertical integration into its own business model, which has otherwise been focused on competing against physical stores with brand-name selections.</p>\n<p>He says that the new approach has so far come in three waves: London Retro, the company’s in-house brand of glasses “entirely created by us, great quality and great style”; Elements, glasses made from recycled products; and Scout, the company’s line aimed at a younger and hipper demographic.</p>\n<p>The combined company will give Prescription Eyewear a much more international footprint — the deal will mean that now more than 60% of sales will come from outside of GlassesDirect’s UK home market. And it says it will make it Europe’s largest online glasses e-commerce company, not just in terms of revenues but also users: 2012 will close off with 8.2 million unique visitors across 100 countries and sites in 12 languages. Actual customer numbers, though, are a bit smaller: 750,000 in total, shipping 2,000 pairs of eyewear daily.</p>\n<p>Taking just Europe alone, there is a lot of potential for growth. The eyewear market is worth $32.5 billion in the region, but only 3-4% of that is online, with many still wedded to the idea of combing through dozens of styles in physical stores. But with bellwether verticals like fashion continuing to grow and thrive on the internet, Prescription Eyewear is confident to ID a “€3-4 billion opportunity” in the European market in the next three to five years. And contact lenses, which don’t require any trying on, is a potentially easier way of working into that potential.</p>\n<p>The founders of LensOn, Kim Persson and Johan Bergenheim, plan to stay on post-acquisition to help expand its business — so far strongest in Northern European markets like Denmark, Sweden, Finland and the UK — into other continental markets like Germany and France.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n 2004\n </p>\n <p>\n \n £10M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>On-line retailer of prescription glasses. </p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <p>Index Ventures is a leading venture capital firm specializing in investments in information technology and life sciences companies.

The Singapore-based company was also named one of the top 10 startups in Asia at Open Web Asia 2012, held in Haikou, China.</p>\n<p>Based in Singapore and Cambridge, Massachusetts, Neoteny Labs focuses on early stage startups in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region (it has also invested in international companies like Path and Viki). QuestVC is headed by James Tan, co-founder of 55tuan, one of China’s top group buy sites, and seeks out companies with “scalability and replicability in large Internet communities.” Launched in December 2011 by Dixon Chan, Elisha Ong and Daniel Hum, the app currently has users in 3,300 cities and 115 countries, who have shared over 170,000 dishes. The founders of Burpple say that partnering up with QuestVC “brings a wealth of knowledge to our growth strategy in China and Southeast Asia,” as well as other markets around the world (the app already has a version in simplified Chinese). </p>\n<p>Aside from having a name that’s fun to say repeatedly, Burpple’s attractive and intuitive interface allows users to easily keep food journals and connect with other people who enjoy eating (and taking photos of) the same dishes and cuisines.</p>\n<p>Chan told me that he and co-founder Ong were inspired to create Burpple while working in Silicon Valley. “We were going to have dinner at this highly rated restaurant, but the menu had 50 different dishes and we didn’t know what to order,” says Chan. “We recalled some friends sharing their recommendations on Facebook and Twitter, but we had great difficulty finding them as these posts were floating around on a sea of social noise.” He also found it hard to pry recommendations from friends who wanted to keep their favorite places to themselves, but didn’t trust reviews from strangers on Yelp and other food apps.</p>\n<p>On Burpple, you can follow your favorite users and “reburp” their tastiest looking meals  or organize food photos into different categories to quickly look up meals based on different criteria (healthy, home-cooked, special occasion, etc). Upload a snapshot to Burpple and it will automatically make note of the time and your location. Burpple uses Foursquare to suggest restaurants based on your location, uploads and reburps.</p>\n<p>Most of Burpple’s users are currently located in China, Japan and Southeast Asia, so you are in luck if you live in those countries or just enjoy slobbering over photos of chicken laksa, chirashi or soup dumplings. There is also a significant presence of US, Canadian and Australian gourmands (the Shack Stack Burger from New York City’s Shake Shack is currently one of the most reburped dishes).</p>\n<p>Burpple is currently available on iOS and an Android version is in the works.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Burpple is a smart and beautiful way to remember, organize and explore food moments with your friends.

The 65-year old Kiwi scientist and inventor accomplishes what he does by keeping tabs on the days he has left to live, and by setting and tracking daily goals to best take advantage of them. </p>\n<p>“I’ve got about 5,625 days to live,” Avery told a group of American entrepreneurs, investors, and journalists visiting the country as part of 500 Startups’ latest Geeks On A Plane event. “When you’re born, you’re born with 30,000 days. That’s it. The best strategic planning I can give to you is to think about that.”</p>\n<p>Avery compared his philosophy around living to the way some people approach entrepreneurship — that is, building something of an exit strategy. The only problem? “In real life, your exit strategy is going to look a lot like mine. But for most of you, it’s going to be a big surprise. </p>\n<p>“For me, I can reverse engineer my life to achieve much more than you guys. Every day I do a chart on what I’ve achieved and where I want to be. And it makes you scary-as-shit clever,” Avery said. “So think about that. You’ve got 30,000 days and the clock is ticking.” (Avery admits to trying to turn his remaining 5,625 days into something more like 10,000 days by multi-tasking.)</p>\n<p>Avery also talked about some of the problems Kiwi entrepreneurs face as they seek to compete on the global stage. One of those issues is a certain degree of humility that results in their achievements sometimes going unrecognized. Avery isn’t immune to this: He only considers himself slightly famous (which he says is terrible), despite being awarded the Kiwibank New Zealander of the Year in 2010 and knighted in 2011.</p>\n<p>His biggest accomplishment is probably introducing low-cost intraocular lens manufacturing facilities in developing markets that made cataract surgery affordable. Since then, he’s worked to make quality healthcare and equipment accessible to some of the world’s poorest nations. His autobiography, Rebel With A Cause, charts his life from a childhood in orphanages and foster homes in the U.K. to becoming one of New Zealand’s most notable scientists. </p>\n<p>But he’s far from the only Kiwi you may not have ever heard of. Avery talked about folks like Colin Murdoch, the inventor of the disposable hypodermic plastic syringe. “What we’re not good at is telling people we’re good at stuff. If you look back at the past 50 years, most people in the world have been touched by [this] invention, and no one knows anything about it. It’s touched more people than the iPhone, television, radio,” Avery said. </p>\n<p>In an effort to correct this, Avery recently published a book entitled “The Power of Us,” which highlights notable Kiwi artists, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders — basically people making a difference who might otherwise go unrecognized. A lot of that innovation comes from using common materials in a more innovative manner — the so-called “number 8 wire” approach to solving problems with unconventional materials. Or a bit of an irreverent attitude toward rules and regulations that are common in other cultures. Either way, it’s Avery’s way of highlighting Kiwis who “dare to dream big.”</p>\n<p>It’s about a cultural state of mind, but it’s also about the ability to try out new things. “Stay in New Zealand long enough,” Avery said, “and you get dangerous.” </p>\n \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:25:57 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "You’ve Got 30,000 Days To Live… Reverse Engineer Your Life To Make Them Count"], ["updated_at", Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:25:57 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/y1CbiTH3Wus/"], ["uuid", "db36a4f0-266b-0130-464b-60c547060a7c"]]

The investment is led by new investor Index Ventures, with participation also from existing backers SEED Capital Denmark and Northzone, the Scandinavian VC that is also an investor in Spotify.</p>\n<p>The Danish company says that it will be using the funds to continue its global expansion with the aim to become the go-to place for people to rate their online shopping experiences. With €5 million in backing prior to this current round, Trustpilot says it is already active in its home country of Denmark, as well as the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands and Italy and is working on extending its reach in the U.S.</p>\n<p>The world of online reviews has had a bad rap, with one main issue being that reviews can be gamed fairly easily with fake complimentary (or critical) posts; another issue is reviews can simply be edited to suit the goals of the company asking for reviews in the first place.</p>\n<p>But even with those credibility gaps, online reviews have come to be seen by many as an important part both of how consumers make decisions online and stay engaged on a site — review forums being a little like proto-social networks of a sort.</p>\n<p>On top of that, there are already a lot of go-to places for reviews. Peter Mühlmann, the founder and CEO of the company, says that Trustpilot is different from the likes of Yelp or eBay-owned Epinions because of its singular focus on e-commerce sites. “Whereas a site like Epinions and others focus on reviews of many different things, we solely focus on reviews of companies that are selling goods or services over the web,” he told me in an interview.</p>\n<p>Trustpilot’s business model is to not only create a primary site of its own where all reviews live — you can search past reviews on Trustpilot.com by searching on company name, and add yours as well — but its business model is based around also offering a set of APIs to integrate their reviews platform on to the e-commerce sites themselves, which companies can run white-label, customized to look like the rest of their sites.</p>\n<p>“Utilizing reviews in ads and on their website boosts companyes’ core KPI’s like click through rates, conversion rates and basket size, which translates directly into improvements on the bottom line,” he notes.</p>\n<p>He says that the company has also now started to see its widgets also getting integrated on to price comparison sites and other third-party platforms. Perhaps the most well-known of these is Google, with whom Trustpilot has a licensing relationship that covers Seller Rating Extensions — customer reviews — which link up with Adwords purchases. Google uses these to drive Adwords purchases, and says that “on average, ads with Seller Ratings get a 17% higher CTR than the same ads without ratings.” Trustpilot says that at this time Google licenses Trustpilot’s reviews for Seller Ratings Extensions on Google.de Google.co.uk, Google.com, Google.fr and Google.nl.</p>\n<p>It may be the dual relationship that Trustpilot is bridging — first between itself and merchants, and then between itself and the likes of Google — which is what makes the company attractive to investors.</p>\n<p>“The Trustpilot concept is a brilliant one which creates substantial value both for merchants who wish to highlight their service credentials and for consumers who want to identify trustworthy service providers in an increasingly crowded online world,” said Ben  Holmes, partner at Index Ventures, in a statement. “The Company has executed the vision excellently and established a strong position in multiple geographies.”</p>\n<p>The Google relationship is not an exclusive one, meaning that if, say, another portal wanted to incorporate Trustpilot reviews to improve their effectiveness in doing business with merchants, or providing more information to their consumers, they could.</p>\n<p>As for the bad rap for reviews, Trustpilot is trying to tackle that, too — starting first with its actual name, but also extending to its business model.</p>\n<p>Essentially, it’s only customers who are contacted to leave reviews — meaning you have to have made a transaction on the site. “As we offer companies a solution to invite all their customers to leave a review of their service, we know there is an actual transaction behind the majority of the reviews,” he notes. That minimizes the chance for random posting, and also means that Trustpilot is gradually building up a strong database of the most engaged consumers.</p>\n<p>Going forward, Mühlmann says he wants to add more gamification and loyalty elements into the service, and to put more focus on authenticity and real identities. It plans to do this by linking up the service more closely with other platforms, like Facebook’s, which consumers have started to trust already with their real identities:</p>\n<p>“I would like it to be more engaging/rewarding to participate on the site,” he says. “I also think that in the reviews space (and in the world of consumer generated content in general),  trust in anonymous contributions is declining, so we are working on making it easier for reviewers to validate themselves (for example by connecting their profile on Trustpilot with various social networks).”</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n 2007\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $5.4M\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Trustpilot is an open, review-driven community connecting online consumers with the companies they buy from. \nShared shopping experiences help consumers make smarter, informed decisions about buying, while companies get concrete feedback from their customers.

It is a crowdsourcing platform that the company refers to as “social knowledge” that it markets to customers for better engagement on brand web sites and now Facebook.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it works: Moxie uses the social chat Facebook API. Its Engage+ App gives companies the ability to access a consumer’s Facebook profile to deliver personalized offers. The customer, usually a mass consumer brand, provides its social data to Moxie, which it then adds to the customer’s knowledge base. The brand gets notified when a Facebook visitor comes to the page who may be interested in the company’s products.</p>\n<p>Moxie Vice President of Products Nikhil Govindaraj said in an interview that the company has learned with experience in following the footprint of users on websites. A customer may have gone to a company web page and looked at an ad, subscribed to a newsletter or meet the demographics that the brand is trying to target. Predictiveness gets better over time as more data is collected. On Facebook, it’s a relatively new game compared to branded web sites. But as with traditional websites, the rules of engagement are defined by the customer’s online behavior with the brand.</p>\n<p>Facebook provides the brand with another channel, but it only works after the social knowledge is acquired.</p>\n<p>The ways in which to collect, analyze, maintain and act upon that data will become a key factor in how the collaboration market grows over the next five to 10 years. It’s data that sits at the heart of this kind of strategy that goes beyond chatting with customers on a Facebook page. It means a rethinking in infrastructure, the meaning of IT and how companies perceive customer experience. The data helps tell the story, but it’s meaningless if the people and processes are not in place. It all has to come together.</p>\n<p>Moxie is in a good place. The company, founded in 2006, has $75 million in funding. It now has an integrated platform that combines its customer-facing technology with its internal collaboration tool.</p>\n<p>General collaboration tools have settled into the market but their impact has been relatively light. In 2006, the market viewed general collaboration as the best way to gain traction. Six years later, adoption is still relatively low. Jive Software and Salesforce.com started their services by offering customers general collaboration tools and have only recently started offering tools that are more oriented to specific channels.</p>\n<p>Moxie is the opposite. It started as a service for specific channels and only later offered a general collaboration tool.</p>\n<p>The Moxie service is robust, but customers are getting more picky about what they decide to adopt. Moxie needs to find more ways to use data analytics to truly differentiate in the crowded collaboration market.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n </div>\n <div>\n <p>We provide the most complete and intuitive social networking software for the enterprise for employee and customer engagement through our Spaces by Moxie applications.

This isn’t special holiday pricing (as 23andMe has run repeatedly in the past) the company tells me, but rather what its normal pricing will be from now on.</p>\n<p>This move is overdue, at least as far as 23andMe’s business model is concerned. Just yesterday TechCrunch Conference Chair Susan Hobbs told me she was waiting for another $99 pricing deal to buy the Personal Genome Analysis product. Sure 23andMe has experimented with various pricing models, including subscription, since its founding in 2007, but had been at an official and prohibitive $299 price point until today. It’s also apparently been rigorously beta-testing various price points in the past couple of weeks, at some point experimenting with some lower than $99.</p>\n<p>For comparison, the company’s original pricing began at $999 and offered subscribers just 14 health and trait reports versus today’s 244 reports, as well as genetic ancestry information. Natera, Counsyl and Pathway Genomics are also in the genomics space, but they work by offering their services through doctors rather than direct to consumer.</p>\n<p>Since the company’s launch five years ago, it’s had 180K civilians profile their DNA, and representative Catherine Afarian tells us that, post-price drop and funding, its goal is to reach a million customrs in 2013. This is a supremely ambitious goal considering it wants to turn an average user acquisition rate of 36K per year into one of 820K in one year alone.</p>\n<p>But Afarian isn’t fazed and brings up how the company once sold out 20k in $99 account inventory on something called “DNA Day.” “Once we can offer the service at $99 it means the average American will buy in,” she said.</p>\n<p>That $299 was too pricey, according to Hobbs, but $99 might be just right. She said the $99 price point, which yes, is less than an iPhone, was the main factor in her decision to buy in. “23andMe is more ‘nice-to-know’ information rather than ‘need-to-know’ information. It’s nice to know your ancestry. It’s more of a need to know that you are predisposed genetically for a type of cancer, so that you may take precautionary measures,” she said, implying that the data given by 23andMe isn’t necessarily vital medical information, or actionable when it is. While 23andMe can give you indicators about certain disease risks, it doesn’t close the loop, as in tell you what to do to prevent these diseases.</p>\n<p>“Its [utility] depends on your genetic data,” said Afarian when I asked her about the usefulness of the product. “If you’ve got a Factor 5 that puts you at risk for clotting, you might want to invest in anti-clotting shots. [And] there’s always something about themselves that people didn’t know.”</p>\n<p>Hobbs said eventually that she wouldn’t buy it, but only because she was looking into more exact lineage information for her little girl, and you need a Y chromosome in all DNA tests to show paternal lineage. Afarian also countered this hesitation, saying that what makes 23andMe unique is that it’s not only looking at only your Y or your mitochondrial DNA, but also your autosomal DNA, which does show some patrilineal information for females who lack that precious Y.</p>\n<p>While still sort of a novelty, the potential for 23andMe goes beyond lineage and hopefully that extra $50 million will go further than keeping the price low and into research. The company hopes that a million users will result in a giant database of 23andWe genetic info that can be used to spot trends, like which genes mean a higher risk of diabetes/cancer, etc. Which is great if it happens but for now remains a pipe dream for 23andMe/We.</p>\n<p>However, beyond Hobbs’ rejection, I’ve already got four TechCrunch staffers either on it already or planning to buy it. “I would use this at its new price point, and I’m a fucking cheapo,” our health and education expert Rip Empson told me on Skype.</p>\n \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:26:02 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Another $50M Richer, 23andMe Drops Its Price To $99 Permanently.

Details of why he departed are unavailable at this time, but we understand he’ll be going to work at a holding company or a portfolio company. Gibney championed the Founders Fund philosophy that startups should change the world, not just build a business.</p>\n<p>Sources say that Gibney’s exit has been in the works for weeks, and he’s no longer with Founders Fund despite still being listed as a partner on its website. Gibney hung back from much of the firm’s investment activity, and was brought in specifically to help it raise its last fund. He also put together Founders Fund’s participation in TaskRabbit’s $13 million Series C in July of this year.</p>\n<p>Gibney was an early investor in PayPal, which is how he got close to Founders Fund’s eventual head honcho Peter Thiel, the payment company’s co-founder. After PayPal was acquired by eBay, Thiel offered Gibney a job at his new hedge fund Clarium Capital.

[["body", "<div><div>\n <p>Jibe Mobile has closed an $8.3 million funding round from investors including Vodafone Ventures, the VC arm of the telco, and Japanese mobile content provider MTI, plus other unnamed investors.</p>\n<p>You may recall Jibe from 2008 — when it was offering a mobile app for sharing content on social networking sites. Since then the company has changed shape — morphing from app maker to platform creator. It’s also been working with carriers to build out IP-based network interconnectedness (aka the Joyn initiative). Right now, Jibe describes itself as a cloud-based global communications provider. Or at least, that’s its ambition — and that grand plan is where the new funding comes in.</p>\n<p>Today’s funding announcement is Jibe’s only external funding to-date (not counting an $800,000 angel investment in its earlier business). In recent years the company had been producing revenues so did not need to seek other funds, the CEO tells me. But its new business has an extremely ambitious scope — firm emphasis on the words ‘global’ and ‘cloud’ here — so the financial resources required to both get it up and running and ensure it can scale as demand grows are an order of magnitude greater than its earlier app effort.</p>\n A Platform For Apps To Call Each Other \n<p>In a nutshell Jibe is building a cloud platform for app developers to more easily (and cheaply) incorporate rich, real-time comms/connected features into their apps — such as VoIP calls, video chatting and over-the-top multiplayer social gaming features. Using its SDK and APIs, Jibe says developers can add a Skype-style video calling feature to their app in a matter of minutes, for instance, by dropping in a few lines of code. </p>\n<p>“In the case of video for example, with four lines of Android code they can make video work inside their app,” says CEO Amir Sarhangi. “They don’t have to know anything about SIP, IMS, any of the technologies that’s used in doing for example video chat – codecs – they don’t need to know any of that.</p>\n<p>“As far as the infrastructure’s concerned, they’re leveraging our infrastructure – we have datacenters in multiple locations in the world and then we have proxy servers stationed in many, many different parts to make the experience really good.”</p>\n<p>As well as having lots of datacenters to shuttle all the bits and bytes around — Jibe has offices in Mountain View, London, Düsseldorf and Tokyo — it is working with carriers to optimise its platform for their individual networks. “Underneath it all, wherever we have relationships with mobile carriers we can deliver a better experience so as an example if you happen to be a Vodafone user you’re just going to get an even better experience because we are tied into their network.</p>\n<p>“But nothing is dependent on carriers so from a developer and a consumer perspective it works everywhere,” he adds. “As we turn on additional carrier relationships, our network gets better and the quality we can deliver gets better.”</p>\n<p>“What we see is a vision of the future where all applications are connected — and by that we mean applications that essentially have things like video chat inside of them, VoIP, the ability to do things like multiplayer gaming with each other – so you’ve got two apps where you can play a game over the mobile network. Something that traditionally has been very very difficult for app developers to do just because of the nature of mobile networks and the complication of being able to deliver on various mobile platforms.”</p>\n From One App To Another \n<p>If you’re still scratching your head at the “cloud-based global communications provider” moniker, here’s a video demonstrating one use-case of Jibe’s platform — showing how an Air Hockey game app is able to incorporate a social gaming multiplayer mode, that allows the user to identify which of their contacts has the app and also has connectivity to play at that particular moment and then send a ‘gaming challenge’ to ask their buddy to play. (“It’s almost like two applications calling each other” is how Sarhangi describes it.)</p>\n<p>Jibe’s cloud platform does the real-time data transfer that links the two apps so the two players can play against each other from their respective phones and locations — with low enough latency levels to ensure decent gameplay. The best performance is on 4G networks (40 to 60ms latency in that instance), but Sarhangi says Jibe’s platform also works on HSPA and 3G networks — although some types of very time-sensitive games may suffer a bit of a performance knock at those slower network speeds.</p>\n<p>Another feature of the platform is the ability to support multitasking real-time applications — so a video call window can be popped out so that other phone features can be accessed by the user while they carry on chatting, for example. The platform isn’t just for game developers either — Sarhangi flags up an e-learning use-case where a developer incorporated a digital white board into the mix to share video from a mobile e-learning app to a classroom screen. Many types of app developers could benefit from catching a ride on Jibe’s cloud, he says.</p>\n Jibe Before The Pivot: Joyn-ing Forces \n<p>This latest Jibe pivot grew out of work it did for Vodafone to help build Joyn – a carrier initiative aimed at ensuring interoperability of IP services (such as IM and picture messaging) across different networks and geographies. Joyn does this through the use of a new, single communications standard — but has yet to get more than a handful of carriers signed up so it remains a work in progress.</p>\n<p>One part of Jibe’s business is to act as a stop-gap for Joyn — to make good on the technology’s interoperability promise before mass carrier adoption achieves the same end (this part of its business is called JoynNet). But while working on Joyn, Sarhangi says Jibe also realised there was space to build a new business that sits between developers and carriers — to help the two groups help each other.</p>\n<p>“We had a lot to do with Joyn to begin with and one of the main passions we have as a company is the fact that in helping create Joyn we realised that it’s extremely difficult for developers to do this stuff,” says Sarhangi. “So how do we make it really simple and, on the other hand, having been with carriers and worked with carriers it is difficult to work with carriers as a small developer, because they’re such a big company, so how do you make that also simple so that you bring the two sides together and break the barriers down.”</p>\n Future features and fees \n<p>In future, as the Jibe cloud platform develops, Sarhangi envisages being able to support four-way video calls, or modify voice or video calls with an overlay. “What you see now is the base, the foundation,” he says, adding that the company intends to be led by its developer community to incorporate the features they request. “When the developers themselves are successful that makes us successful so, for us, it’s not a race for as many features in the world, it’s a race to make them successful.”</p>\n<p>Jibe’s platform, which includes support for Joyn so it’s ‘futureproofed’ for carrier network evolution, currently supports Android apps but the company is working on iOS support (Sarhangi says it will “probably” be making an announcement on iOS availability in early Q1). It is also planning a WebRTC version.</p>\n<p>The platform recently came out of private beta — and has more than 500 developers signed up. While it’s currently free for developers to use, Jibe’s business model involves charging developers in future — although it says it will only charge “once they are successful” – i.e. once their app has exceeded a certain number of concurrent video calls or voice calls made through Jibe’s platform.</p>\n<p>The funding round announced today will be used for “product side” work — such as completing iOS support. It will also be used to scale the platform to cope with increased demand. “Clearly we’re running a global cloud so we need a team to make sure that we can support a truly [global] experience,” says Sarhangi. “We need to be able to deliver [low latency performance] everywhere. And, as we have more of the demand it is pretty resource intensive to work with developers and carriers – two groups that are somewhat fragmented and require a lot of attention.”</p>\n The Carriers’ Cut: A Gamer-Proof Tariff? \n<p>So what’s in it for the carriers to work with Jibe? The chance to “re-innovate around their core services in an all-IP world” — and a world of flat/declining voice and text revenues, says Sarhangi. Jibe’s platform should end up driving data revenues for carriers but more importantly it’s offering them the chance to investigate new business models fit for an age of over-the-top, all-IP services.</p>\n<p>“Traditionally carriers haven’t been very good at doing something for the sake of it, and getting everybody excited about it and then figuring out how to generate the revenues. They’ve always been very financially driven. I worked for Vodafone for almost seven years running products and  services for Vodafone Japan and we never did anything unless it was fully fully thought out and financially feasible,” says Sarhangi.</p>\n<p>“I think now they’re taking a different approach a little bit – they’re trying to take a page out of the internet book of how you do services and this scenario is not just about driving data revenue, it’s about in the future can there be a day where we can sell a plan where game developers can have this ultra high speed experience guaranteed to them for a fee?</p>\n<p>“So it’s about segmenting their packaging and making their networks a lot more smart about how it’s packaged for both developers but also at the end consumers. I’ll pay the extra $5 if you can guarantee me that I’m always going to have a really awesome experience with my friends, playing these multiplayer games.”</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n 2006\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $800k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Jibe – the global communications cloud – is an open technology platform for the new age of telephony.

Your friends aren’t. If you play with them you’ll just crush them and it won’t be any fun. That’s why Zynga’s SVP of mobile Travis Boatman seems unfazed by the end of the game giant’s exclusivity deals with Facebook. During a fireside chat today at the Mobile-Loco Conference in San Francisco, he said “There’s a lot of people who play games and want to connect socially who don’t want to use Facebook.”</p>\n<p>Boatman characterized Facebook as a critical stepping stone in Zynga’s early days, but with time it needed the social network less and less. Fireside chat moderator AJ Glasser of Inside Social Games asked Boatman about the companies’ relationship, and he replied “We’re super fans of Facebook. They were a great partner of ours in founding and growing the company.” But earlier this month, Zynga and Facebook prematurely ended a partnership agreement that guaranteed games would launch on Facebook before Zynga.com. More broadly, it shows the two companies don’t need each other as much as they used to, and will be less likely to give each other special treatment.</p>\n<p>The bulk of Zynga’s business is built on Facebook, and it rises or falls depending on the level of viral distribution it gets in the news feed. That means that being less buddy-buddy with the social network could hurt the growth of its games in the future.</p>\n<p>However, “on the flip side,” Boatman says there are plenty of times when you want to play with humans that you don’t necessarily hang out with and Zynga wants to make those moments happen. For example, he explained that if “You really like to play poker and like to play aggressively, maybe you don’t have any friends who play like that. The relationship with us and Facebook is great but it provides users a lot more value to be able to connect to people who they aren’t friends with on Facebook.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps a way to connect and play with your Twitter friends or an email list will find its way to more Zynga games soon.</p>\n<p>One more interesting tidbit: Boatman admitted that if it wants to turn real-money gambling into a core part of its business, it will need to rely on casual gambling games. “Poker may be too aggressive,” Boatman said, which means it could emphasize games like Zynga Bingo, Go Slots, and Sports Casino, and build or buy other gambling games that don’t require tons of skill or experience. That could keep it more of a gaming company rather than a hardcore gambling company.</p>\n<p>[Image Credit: Katherine Gray / Saturday Evening Post]</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n February 1, 2004\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n NASDAQ:FB \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Facebook is the world’s largest social network, with over 1 billion monthly active users.\nFacebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in February 2004, initially as an exclusive network for Harvard students.

The service enables users to create compelling posters and share them with their friends. But users now get realtime reactions, a web profile with all of their posters, and notifications. With the new features, it is even closer to a hybrid between Instagram and Tumblr.</p>\n<p>“These days, everybody publishes content through social networks, because maintaining a blog is a big commitment,” co-founder Frédéric della Faille said during a phone interview. “Checkthis allows you to publish content that you can’t publish on social networks, without having to set up a separate blog,” he continued.</p>\n<p>Since Ingrid Lunden profiled the startup, users created more than 70,000 posters. On average, each poster was viewed 260 times. With today’s update, Checkthis is becoming even more of a social sharing tool for your text, visual and audio content.</p>\n<p>Checkthis offers a way to share content that would fit on a Tumblr blog, but with a focus on design. Users select colors and fonts, can upload pictures or embed content from other services, such as Soundcloud, Twitter, Google Maps, and yes, Instagram. Then, with one click, you share your poster on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or Pinterest.</p>\n<p>Each poster is like an Instagram picture, with a dedicated URL and realtime comments and likes next to it. Tweets talking about the poster are integrated into the commenting section, as well. Users receive notifications and now have a profile, much like Instagram web profiles.</p>\n<p>Compared to Tumblr, Checkthis removes a lot of friction. Content creators don’t have to select a blog theme and can customize all their posts in very different ways. If you want to share a long message on Twitter or Facebook every now and then, it may be the perfect service. You won’t want to resurface an abandoned Tumblr blog just to add a post.</p>\n<p>The team of seven is based in Belgium and New York, and has raised $910,000 so far. When I asked della Faille to describe the service in one sentence, he said that “the web is boring, Checkthis is a social network for creative people that want to express themselves.”</p>\n <p>This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n January 2011\n </p>\n <p>\n \n $910k\n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Checkthis sits between nothing and a blog.

Both were released at the beginning of November, with the iPad mini debuting as a brand-new form factor and the fourth-gen iPad getting internal component upgrades plus the addition of a Lightning port.</p>\n<p>Compared to past device performance, however, the combined share of both iPads, while small, actually isn’t that far off the pace of previous new device introductions. The “new” or third-generation iPad, for instance, managed to top the original iPad’s share among Apple tablets in month two, which is still well within the realm of possibilities for the period ending in December, since there should be many more iPads in the market by then. This time around, LTE versions of both the iPad mini and full-size, fourth-gen iPad also weren’t available until toward the end of the month, and the impact of users waiting on those versions to purchase could have affected overall share.</p>\n<p>Localytics saw the third-generation iPad climb to 14 percent of overall Apple tablet share within a single week of its launch, so 2 percent for both new models in one month doesn’t look so good by that measure. The iPad 2 remains the most popular version overall, still making up more than half of all usage of apps running Localytics’ mobile analytics platform.</p>\n<p>Engagement, based on iPad session length, also turns up shorter average time spent in-app on newer iPads, including the shortest time of all on the iPad mini. That’s something Localytics chalks up to its smaller form factor, which may have users treating it more like a smartphone than other Apple tablets. Both also showed fewer sessions per user spent on average than other Apple tablet hardware, but the iPad mini edged out the fourth-generation iPad in this category.</p>\n<p>For the iPhone, the iPhone 5 now makes up 12 percent of all app usage, trailing both the iPhone 4S at 42 percent, and the iPhone 4 at 39 percent. The iPhone 5, available since September, is essentially tied with the iPhone 4S in terms of engagement as measured by average session length, and it exceeds the iPhone 3GS in terms of the number of sessions per user.</p>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n <div>\n \n \n <p>\n \n April 1, 1976\n </p>\n <p>\n \n \n NASDAQ:AAPL \n </p>\n </div>\n <div>\n <p>Started by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne, Apple has expanded from computers to consumer electronics over the last 30 years, officially changing their name from Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple, Inc. in January 2007.\nAmong the key offerings from Apple’s product line are: Pro line laptops (MacBook Pro) and desktops (Mac Pro), consumer line laptops (MacBook Air) and desktops (iMac), servers (Xserve), Apple TV, the Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server operating systems, the iPod, the...</p>\n </div>\n \n </div>\n → Learn more\n </div> \n \n </div>\n </div>\n </div>\n \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:26:14 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "Report Finds iPad Mini And 4th-Gen iPad Each Took 2% Of Apple Tablet Market Share In November"], ["updated_at", Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:26:14 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/_wqTLhgllNQ/"], ["uuid", "e513bec0-266b-0130-4655-60c547060a7c"]]

This new version, called “Elvin” in honor of drummer Elvin Jones, mostly changes how WordPress users interact with images and includes a number of smaller tweaks to various other parts of the application, too.</p>\n<p>The first thing you will notice after the update is the new image uploader. WordPress says working with the new image management system is “a beautifully simple experience.” In the announcement, WordPress and Automattic founder Matt Mullenweg says that “media has long been a friction point and we’ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system.”</p>\n<p>The reality, however, is that this change takes quite a bit of getting used to. Here at TechCrunch, we’ve been using the new version for a bit now and even though most of us have gotten used to the new media manager, it often feels like it takes an extra click or two to do basic things like adding featured images to a post.</p>\n<p>One thing the new media manager definitely gets right is the new workflow for creating galleries. This used to be a major pain point, but is now significantly easier thanks to drag-and-drop reordering, inline caption editing, and simplified controls.</p>\n<p>Here is a brief run-through of what the new image workflow looks like in WordPress 3.5:</p>\n<p>Also new in this version are refreshed styles for the dashboard and a new color picker. The whole admin area has now also been updated to look good on high-resolution Retina displays.</p>\n<p>In addition, WordPress is using this launch to introduce its newest default theme, Twenty Twelve. The new theme, writes Mullenweg, “has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site.”</p>\n<p>The new version, of course, also comes with a number of new features for developers. You can find a full list of those changes here.</p>\n \n \n \n </div></div>"], ["created_at", Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:26:16 UTC +00:00], ["deleted_at", nil], ["id", nil], ["rss_id", nil], ["title", "WordPress 3.5 “Elvin” Launches With A Completely New Media Manager, Retina Support, Responsive Default Theme"], ["updated_at", Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:26:16 UTC +00:00], ["url", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/rv62DEPnHtY/"], ["uuid", "e6162e80-266b-0130-4656-60c547060a7c"]]
